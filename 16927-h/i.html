<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>Tacitus held the consulship under Nerva in the year 97. At this
point he closed his public career. He had reached the goal of a
politician's ambition and had become known as one of the best
speakers of his time, but he seems to have realized that under the
Principate politics was a dull farce, and that oratory was of little
value in a time of peace and strong government. The rest of his life
was to be spent in writing history. In the year of his consulship or
immediately after it, he published the <i>Agricola</i> and <i>Germania</i>,
short monographs in which he practised the transition from the style
of the speaker to that of the writer. In the preface to the
<i>Agricola</i> he foreshadows the larger work on which he is engaged. 'I
shall find it a pleasant task to put together, though in rough and
unfinished style, a memorial of our former slavery and a record of
our present happiness.' His intention was to write a history of the
Principate from Augustus to Trajan. He began with his own times, and
wrote in twelve or fourteen books a full account of the period from
Nero's death in 68 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> to the death of Domitian in 96
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> These were published, probably in successive books,
between 106 and 109 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> Only the first four and a half
books survive to us. They deal with the years 69 and 70, and are
known as <i>The Histories</i>. <i>The <a name="page6" id="page6" ></a><span class="pagenum">6</span>Annals</i>, which soon followed, dealt
with the Julian dynasty after the death of Augustus. Of Augustus'
constitution of the principate and of Rome's 'present happiness'
under Trajan, Tacitus did not live to write.</p>

<p><i>The Histories</i>, as they survive to us, describe in a style that has
made them immortal one of the most terrible and crucial moments of
Roman history. The deadly struggle for the throne demonstrated
finally the real nature of the Principate&mdash;based not on
constitutional fictions but on armed force&mdash;and the supple
inefficiency of the senatorial class. The revolt on the Rhine
foreshadowed the debacle of the fifth century. Tacitus was
peculiarly well qualified to write the history of this period. He
had been the eye-witness of some of the most terrible scenes: he was
acquainted with all the distinguished survivors: his political
experience gave him a statesman's point of view, and his rhetorical
training a style which mirrored both the terror of the times and his
own emotion. More than any other Roman historian he desired to tell
the truth and was not fatally biassed by prejudice. It is wrong to
regard Tacitus as an 'embittered rhetorician', an 'enemy of the
Empire', a 'd&eacute;tracteur de l'humanit&eacute;'.<a name="fnm1" id="fnm1"></a><a href="#fn1" class="fnnum">1</a> He was none of these. As a
member of a noble, though not an ancient, family, and as one who had
completed the republican <i>cursus honorum</i>, his sympathies were
naturally senatorial. He regretted that the days were passed when
oratory was a real power and the consuls were the twin towers of the
world. But he never hoped <a name="page7" id="page7" ></a><span class="pagenum">7</span>to see such days again. He realized that
monarchy was essential to peace, and that the price of freedom was
violence and disorder. He had no illusions about the senate. Fault
and misfortune had reduced them to nerveless servility, a luxury of
self-abasement. Their meekness would never inherit the earth.
Tacitus pours scorn on the philosophic opponents of the Principate,
who while refusing to serve the emperor and pretending to hope for
the restoration of the republic, could contribute nothing more
useful than an ostentatious suicide. His own career, and still more
the career of his father-in-law Agricola, showed that even under bad
emperors a man could be great without dishonour. Tacitus was no
republican in any sense of the word, but rather a monarchist <i>malgr&eacute;
lui</i>. There was nothing for it but to pray for good emperors and put
up with bad ones.</p>

<p>Those who decry Tacitus for prejudice against the Empire forget that
he is describing emperors who were indubitably bad. We have lost his
account of Vespasian's reign. His praise of Augustus and of Trajan
was never written. The emperors whom he depicts for us were all
either tyrannical or contemptible, or both: no floods of modern
biography can wash them white. They seemed to him to have degraded
Roman life and left no room for <i>virtus</i> in the world. The verdict
of Rome had gone against them. So he devotes to their portraiture
the venom which the fifteen years of Domitian's reign of terror had
engendered in his heart. He was inevitably a pessimist; his ideals
lay <a name="page8" id="page8" ></a><span class="pagenum">8</span>in the past; yet he clearly shows that he had some hope of the
future. Without sharing Pliny's faith that the millennium had
dawned, he admits that Nerva and Trajan have inaugurated 'happier
times' and combined monarchy with some degree of personal freedom.</p>

<p>There are other reasons for the 'dark shadows' in Tacitus' work.
History to a Roman was <i>opus oratorium,</i> a work of literary art.
Truth is a great but not a sufficient merit. The historian must be
not only <i>narrator</i> but <i>ornator rerum</i>. He must carefully select
and arrange the incidents, compose them into an effective group, and
by the power of language make them memorable and alive. In these
books Tacitus has little but horrors to describe: his art makes them
unforgettably horrible. The same art is ready to display the beauty
of courage and self-sacrifice. But these were rarer phenomena than
cowardice and greed. It was not Tacitus, but the age, which showed a
preference for vice. Moreover, the historian's art was not to be
used solely for its own sake. All ancient history was written with a
moral object; the ethical interest predominates almost to the
exclusion of all others. Tacitus is never merely literary. The
&#963;&#949;&#956;&#957;&#972;&#964;&#951;&#962; which Pliny notes as the characteristic of his
oratory, never lets him sparkle to no purpose. All his pictures have
a moral object 'to rescue virtue from oblivion and restrain vice by
the terror of posthumous infamy'.<a name="fnm2" id="fnm2"></a><a href="#fn2" class="fnnum">2</a> His prime interest is
character: and when he has <a name="page9" id="page9" ></a><span class="pagenum">9</span>conducted some skilful piece of moral
diagnosis there attaches to his verdict some of the severity of a
sermon. If you want to make men better you must uncover and scarify
their sins.</p>

<p>Few Christian moralists deal much in eulogy, and Tacitus' diatribes
are the more frequent and the more fierce because his was the
morality not of Christ but of Rome. 'The Poor' are as dirt to him:
he can stoop to immortalize some gleam of goodness in low life, but
even then his main object is by scorn of contrast to galvanize the
aristocracy into better ways. Only in them can true <i>virtus</i> grow.
Their degradation seems the death of goodness. Tacitus had little
sympathy with the social revolution that was rapidly completing
itself, not so much because those who rose from the masses lacked
'blood', but because they had not been trained in the right
traditions. In the decay of Education he finds a prime cause of
evil. And being a Roman&mdash;wherever he may have been born&mdash;he
inevitably feels that the decay of Roman life must rot the world.
His eyes are not really open to the Empire. He never seems to think
that in the spacious provinces to which the old Roman virtues had
taken flight, men were leading happy, useful lives, because the
strong hand of the imperial government had come to save them from
the inefficiency of aristocratic governors. This narrowness of view
accounts for much of Tacitus' pessimism.</p>

<p>Recognition of the atmosphere in which Tacitus wrote and the objects
at which his history aimed helps <a name="page10" id="page10" ></a><span class="pagenum">10</span>one to understand why it sometimes
disappoints modern expectations. Particular scenes are seared on our
memories: persons stand before us lit to the soul by a fierce light
of psychological analysis: we learn to loath the characteristic
vices of the time, and to understand the moral causes of Roman
decadence. But somehow the dominance of the moral interest and the
frequent interruption of the narrative by scenes of senatorial
inefficiency serve to obscure the plain sequence of events. It is
difficult after a first reading of the <i>Histories</i> to state clearly
what happened in these two years. And this difficulty is vastly
annoying to experts who wish to trace the course of the three
campaigns. Those whose interest is not in Tacitus but in the
military history of the period are recommended to study Mr. B.W.
Henderson's <i>Civil War and Rebellion in the Roman Empire</i>, a
delightful book which makes the dark places plain. But they are not
recommended to share his contempt for Tacitus because his accounts
of warfare are as bad as, for instance, Shakespeare's. Tacitus does
not describe in detail the tactics and geography of a campaign,
perhaps because he could not do so, certainly because he did not
wish to. He regarded such details as dry bones, which no amount of
literary skill could animate. His interest is in human character.
Plans of campaign throw little light on that: so they did not
interest him, or, if they did, he suppressed his interest because he
knew that his public would otherwise behave as Dr. Johnson did when
Fox talked to him of Catiline's <a name="page11" id="page11" ></a><span class="pagenum">11</span>conspiracy. 'He withdrew his
attention and thought about Tom Thumb.'</p>

<p>There is no worse fault in criticism than to blame a work of art for
lacking qualities to which it makes no pretension. Tacitus is not a
'bad military historian'. He is not a 'military' historian at all.
Botticelli is not a botanist, nor is Shakespeare a geographer. It is
this fault which leads critics to call Tacitus 'a stilted pleader at
a decadent bar', and to complain that his narrative of the war with
Civilis is 'made dull and unreal by speeches'&mdash;because they have not
found in Tacitus what they had no right to look for. Tacitus inserts
speeches for the same reason that he excludes tactical details. They
add to the human interest of his work. They give scope to his great
dramatic powers, to that passionate sympathy with character which
finds expression in a style as nervous as itself. They enable him to
display motives, to appraise actions, to reveal moral forces. It is
interest in human nature rather than pride of rhetoric which makes
him love a good debate.</p>

<p>The supreme distinction of Tacitus is, of course, his style. That is
lost in a translation. 'Hard' though his Latin is, it is not
obscure. Careful attention can always detect his exact thought. Like
Meredith he is 'hard' because he does so much with words. Neither
writer leaves any doubt about his meaning. It is therefore a
translator's first duty to be lucid, and not until that duty is done
may he try by faint flushes of epigram to reflect something of the
brilliance of <a name="page12" id="page12" ></a><span class="pagenum">12</span>Tacitus' Latin. Very faint indeed that reflection
must always be: probably no audience could be found to listen to a
translation of Tacitus, yet one feels that his Latin would challenge
and hold the attention of any audience that was not stone-deaf. But
it is because Tacitus is never a mere stylist that some of us
continue in the failure to translate him. His historical deductions
and his revelations of character have their value for every age.
'This form of history,' says Montaigne, 'is by much the most useful
... there are in it more precepts than stories: it is not a book to
read, 'tis a book to study and learn: 'tis full of sententious
opinions, right or wrong: 'tis a nursery of ethic and politic
discourses, for the use and ornament of those who have any place in
the government of the world.... His pen seems most proper for a
troubled and sick state, as ours at present is; you would often say
it is us he paints and pinches.' Sir Henry Savile, Warden of Merton
and Provost of Eton, who translated the <i>Histories</i> into racy
Elizabethan English at a time when the state was neither 'troubled'
nor 'sick' is as convinced as Montaigne or the theorists of the
French Revolution that Tacitus had lessons for his age. 'In Galba
thou maiest learne, that a Good Prince gouerned by evill ministers
is as dangerous as if he were evill himselfe. By Otho, that the
fortune of a rash man is <i>Torrenti similis</i>, which rises at an
instant, and falles in a moment. By Vitellius, that he that hath no
vertue can neuer be happie: for by his own baseness he will loose
all, which either fortune, or other mens labours <a name="page13" id="page13" ></a><span class="pagenum">13</span>have cast upon
him. By Vespasian, that in civill tumults an advised patience, and
opportunitie well taken are the onely weapons of advantage. In them
all, and in the state of Rome under them thou maiest see the
calamities that follow civill warres, where lawes lie asleepe, and
all things are iudged by the sword. If thou mislike their warres be
thankfull for thine owne peace; if thou dost abhor their tyrannies,
love and reverence thine owne wise, iust and excellent Prince.' So
whatever guise our age may assume, there are lessons to be drawn
from Tacitus either directly or <i>per contra</i>, and his translators
may be acquitted at a time when Latin scholarship is no longer an
essential of political eminence.</p>

<h3><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>Preface</h3>

<p><a name="Ichap1" id="Ichap1"></a><span class="chapnum">1</span>[<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 69.] I propose to begin my narrative with the
second consulship of Servius Galba, in which Titus Vinius was his
colleague. Many historians have dealt with the 820 years of the
earlier period beginning with the foundation of Rome, and the story
of the Roman Republic has been told with no less ability than truth.
After the Battle of Actium, when the interests of peace were served
by the centralization of all authority in the hands of one man,
there followed a dearth of literary ability, and at the same time
truth suffered more and more, partly from ignorance of politics,
which were no longer a citizen's concern, partly from the growing
taste for flattery or from hatred of the ruling house. So between
malice on one side and servility on the other the interests of
posterity were neglected. But historians find that a tone of
flattery soon incurs the stigma of servility and earns for them the
contempt of their readers, whereas people readily open their ears to
the criticisms of envy, since malice makes a show of independence.
Of Galba, Otho, and Vitellius, I have known nothing either to my
advantage or my hurt. I cannot deny that I originally owed my
position to Vespasian, or that I was advanced by Titus and still
<a name="page18" id="page18" ></a><span class="pagenum">18</span>further promoted by Domitian;<a name="fnm5" id="fnm5"></a><a href="#fn5" class="fnnum">5</a> but professing, as I do, unbiassed
honesty, I must speak of no man either with hatred or affection. I
have reserved for my old age, if life is spared to me, the reigns of
the sainted Nerva and of the Emperor Trajan, which afford a richer
and withal a safer theme:<a name="fnm6" id="fnm6"></a><a href="#fn6" class="fnnum">6</a> for it is the rare fortune of these
days that a man may think what he likes and say what he thinks.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap2" id="Ichap2"></a><span class="chapnum">2</span>The story I now commence is rich in vicissitudes, grim with
warfare, torn by civil strife, a tale of horror even during times of
peace. It tells of four emperors slain by the sword, three several
civil wars, an even larger number of foreign wars and some that were
both at once: successes in the East, disaster in the West,
disturbance in Illyricum, disaffection in the provinces of Gaul, the
conquest of Britain and its immediate loss, the rising of the
Sarmatian and Suebic tribes. It tells how Dacia had the privilege of
exchanging blows with Rome, and how a pretender claiming to be Nero
almost deluded the Parthians into declaring war. Now too Italy was
smitten with new disasters, or disasters it had not witnessed for a
long period of years. Towns along the rich coast of Campania were
<a name="page19" id="page19" ></a><span class="pagenum">19</span>submerged or buried. The city was devastated by fires, ancient
temples were destroyed, and the Capitol itself was fired by Roman
hands. Sacred rites were grossly profaned, and there were scandals
in high <a name="fnm7" id="fnm7"></a>places.<a href="#fn7" class="fnnum">7</a> The sea swarmed with exiles and the island
<a name="fnm8" id="fnm8"></a>cliffs<a href="#fn8" class="fnnum">8</a> were red with blood. Worse horrors reigned in the city. To
be rich or well-born was a crime: men were prosecuted for holding or
for refusing office: merit of any kind meant certain ruin. Nor were
the Informers more hated for their crimes than for their prizes:
some carried off a priesthood or the consulship as their spoil,
others won offices and influence in the imperial household: the
hatred and fear they inspired worked universal havoc. Slaves were
bribed against their masters, freedmen against their patrons, and,
if a man had no enemies, he was ruined by his friends.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap3" id="Ichap3"></a><span class="chapnum">3</span>However, the period was not so utterly barren as to yield no
examples of heroism. There were mothers who followed their sons, and
wives their husbands into exile: one saw here a kinsman's courage
and there a son-in-law's devotion: slaves obstinately faithful even
on the rack: distinguished men bravely facing the utmost straits and
matching in their end the famous deaths of older times. Besides
these manifold disasters to mankind there were portents in the sky
and on the earth, thunderbolts and other <a name="page20" id="page20" ></a><span class="pagenum">20</span>premonitions of good and
of evil, some doubtful, some obvious. Indeed never has it been
proved by such terrible disasters to Rome or by such clear evidence
that Providence is concerned not with our peace of mind but rather
with vengeance for our sin.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="fn5" id="fn5"></a><span class="label"><a href="#fnm5">5</a> </span>To Vespasian Tacitus probably owed his quaestorship and
a seat in the senate; to Titus his tribunate of the people; to
Domitian the praetorship and a 'fellowship' of one of the great
priestly colleges, whose special function was the supervision of
foreign cults. This last accounts for Tacitus' interest in strange
religions.</p></div>

<h3><a name="The_State_of_the_Empire" id="The_State_of_the_Empire"></a>The State of the Empire</h3>

<p><a name="Ichap4" id="Ichap4"></a><span class="chapnum">4</span>Before I commence my task, it seems best to go back and
consider the state of affairs in the city, the temper of the armies,
the condition of the provinces, and to determine the elements of
strength and weakness in the different quarters of the Roman world.
By this means we may see not only the actual course of events, which
is largely governed by chance, but also why and how they occurred.</p>

<p>The death of Nero, after the first outburst of joy with which it was
greeted, soon aroused conflicting feelings not only among the
senators, the people, and the soldiers in the city, but also among
the generals and their troops abroad. It had divulged a secret of
state: an emperor could be made elsewhere than at Rome. Still the
senate was satisfied. They had immediately taken advantage of their
liberty and were naturally emboldened against a prince who was new
to the throne and, moreover, absent. The highest class of the
<a name="fnm9" id="fnm9"></a>knights<a href="#fn9" class="fnnum">9</a> seconded the senate's satisfaction. Respectable citizens,
who were attached as clients or freedmen to the great families, and
had seen their <a name="page21" id="page21" ></a><span class="pagenum">21</span>patrons condemned or exiled, now revived their
hopes. The lowest classes, who had grown familiar with the pleasures
of the theatre and the circus, the most degraded of the slaves, and
Nero's favourites who had squandered their property and lived on his
discreditable bounty, all showed signs of depression and an eager
greed for news.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap5" id="Ichap5"></a><span class="chapnum">5</span>The troops in the <a name="fnm10" id="fnm10"></a>city<a href="#fn10" class="fnnum">10</a> had long been inured to the
allegiance of the Caesars, and it was more by the pressure of
intrigue than of their own inclination that they came to desert
Nero. They soon realized that the donation promised in Galba's name
was not to be paid to them, and that peace would not, like war,
offer opportunity for great services and rich rewards. Since they
also saw that the new emperor's favour had been forestalled by the
army which proclaimed him, they were ripe for revolution and were
further instigated by their rascally Praefect Nymphidius Sabinus,
who was plotting to be emperor himself. His design was as a matter
of fact detected and quashed, but, though the ringleader was
removed, many of the troops still felt conscious of their treason
and could be heard commenting on Galba's senility and avarice. His
austerity&mdash;a quality once admired and set high in soldiers'
estimation&mdash;only annoyed troops whose contempt for the old methods
of discipline had been fostered by fourteen years of service <a name="page22" id="page22" ></a><span class="pagenum">22</span>under
Nero. They had come to love the emperors' vices as much as they once
reverenced their virtues in older days. Moreover Galba had let fall
a remark, which augured well for Rome, though it spelt danger to
himself. 'I do not buy my soldiers,' he said, 'I select them.' And
indeed, as things then stood, his words sounded incongruous.</p>

<h3><a name="Galbas_Position" id="Galbas_Position"></a>Galba's Position</h3>

<p><a name="Ichap6" id="Ichap6"></a><span class="chapnum">6</span>Galba was old and ill. Of his two lieutenants Titus Vinius
was the vilest of men and Cornelius Laco the laziest. Hated as he
was for Vinius' crimes and despised for Laco's inefficiency, between
them Galba soon came to ruin. His march from Spain was slow and
stained with bloodshed. He executed Cingonius Varro, the
consul-elect, and Petronius Turpilianus, an ex-consul, the former as
an accomplice of Nymphidius, the latter as one of Nero's generals.
They were both denied any opportunity of a hearing or defence&mdash;and
might as well have been innocent. On his arrival at Rome the
butchery of thousands of unarmed <a name="fnm11" id="fnm11"></a>soldiers<a href="#fn11" class="fnnum">11</a> gave an ill omen to
his entry, and alarmed even the men who did the slaughter. The city
was filled with strange troops. A legion had been brought from
Spain,<a name="fnm12" id="fnm12"></a><a href="#fn12" class="fnnum">12</a> and the regiment of marines enrolled by Nero still
remained.<a href="#fn11" class="fnnum">11</a> Moreover there were several detachments <a name="page23" id="page23" ></a><span class="pagenum">23</span>from Germany,
Britain, and <a name="fnm13" id="fnm13"></a>Illyricum,<a href="#fn13" class="fnnum">13</a> which had been selected by Nero,
dispatched to the Caspian <a name="fnm14" id="fnm14"></a>Pass<a href="#fn14" class="fnnum">14</a> for the projected war against the
Albanians, and subsequently recalled to aid in crushing the revolt
of <a name="fnm15" id="fnm15"></a>Vindex.<a href="#fn15" class="fnnum">15</a> These were all fine fuel for a revolution, and,
although their favour centred on nobody in particular, there they
were at the disposal of any one who had enterprise.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap7" id="Ichap7"></a><span class="chapnum">7</span>It happened by chance that the news of the death of Clodius
Macer and of Fonteius Capito arrived in Rome simultaneously.
Macer,<a name="fnm16" id="fnm16"></a><a href="#fn16" class="fnnum">16</a> who was undoubtedly raising a disturbance in Africa, was
put to death by the imperial agent Trebonius Garutianus, acting
under Galba's orders: <a name="fnm17" id="fnm17"></a>Capito<a href="#fn17" class="fnnum">17</a> had made a similar attempt in
Germany and was killed by two officers, Cornelius Aquinus and Fabius
Valens, without waiting for instructions. While Capito had a foul
reputation for extortion and loose living, some people yet believed
<a name="page24" id="page24" ></a><span class="pagenum">24</span>that he had withheld his hand from treason. His officers, they
supposed, had urged him to declare war, and, when they could not
persuade him, had gone on to charge him falsely with their own
offence,<a name="fnm18" id="fnm18"></a><a href="#fn18" class="fnnum">18</a> while Galba from weakness of character, or perhaps
because he was afraid to inquire too far, approved what had happened
for good or for ill, since it was past alteration. At any rate both
executions were unpopular. Now that Galba was disliked, everything
he did, whether right or wrong, made him more unpopular. His
freedmen were all-powerful: money could do anything: the slaves were
thirsting for an upheaval, and with so elderly an emperor were
naturally expecting to see one soon. The evils of the new court were
those of the old, and while equally oppressive were not so easily
excused. Even Galba's age seemed comic and despicable to a populace
that was used to the young Nero and compared the emperors, as such
people will, in point of looks and personal attraction.</p>

<h3><a name="The_Distribution_of_Forces" id="The_Distribution_of_Forces"></a>The Distribution of Forces</h3>

<p><a name="Ichap8" id="Ichap8"></a><span class="chapnum">8</span>Such then at Rome was the variety of feeling natural in so
vast a population. To turn to the provinces abroad: Spain was under
the command of Cluvius Rufus, a man of great eloquence, and more
skilled in the arts of peace than of <a name="fnm19" id="fnm19"></a>war.<a href="#fn19" class="fnnum">19</a> The Gallic provinces
had not forgotten Vindex: moreover, they <a name="page25" id="page25" ></a><span class="pagenum">25</span>were bound to Galba by his
recent grant of Roman citizenship and his rebate of their tribute
for the future. The tribes, however, which lay nearest to the armies
stationed in Germany had not received these honours: some even had
lost part of their territory and were equally aggrieved at the
magnitude of their own injuries and of their neighbours' benefits.
The troops in Germany were proud of their recent victory, indignant
at their treatment and perplexed by a nervous consciousness that
they had supported the wrong side: a very dangerous state for so
strong a force to be in. They had been slow to desert Nero, and
<a name="fnm20" id="fnm20"></a>Verginius<a href="#fn20" class="fnnum">20</a> did not immediately declare for Galba. Whether he
really did not want the throne is doubtful: without question his
soldiers made him the offer. The death of Fonteius Capito aroused
the indignation even of those who had no right to complain. However,
they still lacked a leader: Galba had sent for Verginius under a
pretence of friendship, and, when he was not allowed to return and
was even charged with treachery, the soldiers considered his case
their own.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap9" id="Ichap9"></a><span class="chapnum">9</span>The army of Upper Germany felt no respect for their
commander, Hordeonius <a name="fnm21" id="fnm21"></a>Flaccus.<a href="#fn21" class="fnnum">21</a> Weakened by age and an affection
of the feet he was without resolution or authority, and could not
have controlled the mildest troops. These fiery spirits were only
the further inflamed when they felt such a weak hand on the reins.
The legions of Lower Germany had been <a name="page26" id="page26" ></a><span class="pagenum">26</span>for some time without a
commander,<a name="fnm22" id="fnm22"></a><a href="#fn22" class="fnnum">22</a> until Aulus Vitellius appeared. He was the son of the
Lucius Vitellius who had been censor and thrice <a name="fnm23" id="fnm23"></a>consul,<a href="#fn23" class="fnnum">23</a> and
Galba thought this sufficient to impress the troops. The army in
Britain showed no bad feeling. All through the disturbance of the
civil wars no troops kept cleaner hands. This may have been because
they were so far away and severed by the sea, or perhaps frequent
engagements had taught them to keep their rancour for the enemy.
Quiet ruled in Illyricum also, although the legions, which had been
summoned by <a name="fnm24" id="fnm24"></a>Nero,<a href="#fn24" class="fnnum">24</a> while lingering in Italy had made overtures to
Verginius. But the armies lay far apart, always a sound assistance
to the maintenance of military discipline, since the men could
neither share vices nor join forces.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap10" id="Ichap10"></a><span class="chapnum">10</span>The East was still untroubled. Licinius Mucianus held Syria
with four <a name="fnm25" id="fnm25"></a>legions.<a href="#fn25" class="fnnum">25</a> He was a man who was always famous, whether
in good fortune or in bad. As a youth he was ambitious and
cultivated the friendship of the great. Later he found himself in
straitened circumstances and a very ambiguous position, and,
suspecting Claudius' displeasure, he withdrew into the wilds of
Asia, where he came as near to being an exile as afterwards to being
an emperor. He was <a name="page27" id="page27" ></a><span class="pagenum">27</span>a strange mixture of good and bad, of luxury and
industry, courtesy and arrogance. In leisure he was self-indulgent,
but full of vigour on service. His outward behaviour was
praiseworthy, though ill was spoken of his private life. However,
with those who were under him or near him, and with his colleagues
he gained great influence by various devices, and seems to have been
the sort of man who would more readily make an emperor than be one.</p>

<p>The Jewish war was being conducted by Flavius Vespasianus&mdash;appointed
by Nero&mdash;with three <a name="fnm26" id="fnm26"></a>legions.<a href="#fn26" class="fnnum">26</a> He had no ill-will against Galba,
and nothing to hope from his fall. Indeed he had sent his son Titus
to carry his compliments and offer allegiance, an incident we must
reserve for its proper <a name="fnm27" id="fnm27"></a>place.<a href="#fn27" class="fnnum">27</a> It was only after Vespasian's rise
that Roman society came to believe in the mysterious movings of
Providence, and supposed that portents and oracles had predestined
the throne for him and his family.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap11" id="Ichap11"></a><span class="chapnum">11</span>Of Egypt and its garrison, ever since the days of the
sainted Augustus, the knights of Rome have been uncrowned <a name="fnm28" id="fnm28"></a>kings.<a href="#fn28" class="fnnum">28</a>
The province being difficult to reach, rich in crops, torn and
tossed by fanaticism and sedition, ignorant of law, unused to
bureaucratic government, it seemed wiser to keep it in the control
<a name="page28" id="page28" ></a><span class="pagenum">28</span>of the <a name="fnm29" id="fnm29"></a>Household.<a href="#fn29" class="fnnum">29</a> The governor at that date was Tiberius
Alexander, himself a native of <a name="fnm30" id="fnm30"></a>Egypt.<a href="#fn30" class="fnnum">30</a> Africa and its legions,
now that Clodius Macer had been <a name="fnm31" id="fnm31"></a>executed,<a href="#fn31" class="fnnum">31</a> were ready to put up
with any ruler after their experience of a petty master. The two
Mauretanias, Raetia, Noricum, Thrace, and the other provinces
governed by procurators had their sympathies determined by the
neighbourhood of troops, and always caught their likes or dislikes
from the strongest army. The ungarrisoned provinces, and chief
amongst these Italy, were destined to be the prize of war, and lay
at the mercy of any master. Such was the state of the Roman world
when Servius Galba, consul for the second time, and Titus Vinius his
colleague, inaugurated the year which was to be their last, and
almost the last for the commonwealth of Rome.</p>

<h3><a name="The_German_Revolt" id="The_German_Revolt"></a>The German Revolt and the Adoption of Piso</h3>

<p><a name="Ichap12" id="Ichap12"></a><span class="chapnum">12</span>A few days after the first of January a dispatch arrived
from Belgica, in which Pompeius <a name="fnm32" id="fnm32"></a>Propinquus,<a href="#fn32" class="fnnum">32</a> the imperial agent,
announced that the legions of <a name="page29" id="page29" ></a><span class="pagenum">29</span>Upper Germany had broken their oath
of allegiance and were clamouring for a new emperor, but that by way
of tempering their treason they referred the final choice to the
Senate and People of Rome. Galba had already been deliberating and
seeking advice as to the adoption of a successor, and this
occurrence hastened his plans. During all these months this question
formed the current subject of gossip throughout the country; Galba
was far spent in years and the general propensity for such a topic
knew no check. Few people showed sound judgement or any spirit of
patriotism. Many were influenced by foolish hopes and spread
self-interested rumours pointing to some friend or patron, thereby
also gratifying their hatred for Titus <a name="fnm33" id="fnm33"></a>Vinius,<a href="#fn33" class="fnnum">33</a> whose
unpopularity waxed daily with his power. Galba's affability only
served to strengthen the gaping ambition of his newly powerful
friends, for his weakness and credulity halved the risk and doubled
the reward of treason.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap13" id="Ichap13"></a><span class="chapnum">13</span>The real power of the throne was divided between the
consul, Titus Vinius, and Cornelius Laco, the prefect of the Guards;
and an influence as great was enjoyed by Icelus, one of Galba's
freedmen, who had been given the gold <a name="fnm34" id="fnm34"></a>ring<a href="#fn34" class="fnnum">34</a> and was now greeted
by the name of Marcianus. These three ordinarily disagreed, and
followed each his own interest in smaller <a name="page30" id="page30" ></a><span class="pagenum">30</span>matters: on the question
of the succession they fell into two camps. Vinius was for Marcus
Otho. Laco and Icelus were agreed not so much on any one as on any
other. Galba was aware of the friendship between Otho and Vinius.
Otho was a bachelor and Vinius had an unmarried daughter: so gossip,
never reticent, pointed to them as father and son-in-law. Galba, one
may suppose, felt some concern for his country, too. Why take the
throne from Nero, if it was to be left to Otho? Otho had led a
careless boyhood and a dissolute youth, and endeared himself to Nero
by aping his vices. Thus it was to Otho, as being already in the
secret, that Nero entrusted his favourite mistress, Poppaea
Sabina,<a name="fnm35" id="fnm35"></a><a href="#fn35" class="fnnum">35</a> until he could get rid of Octavia. Later he grew jealous
and removed Otho to the province of Lusitania under cover of a
governorship. Otho had been popular in his administration of the
province, and was one of the first to join Galba's party. Being a
man of action and one of the most distinguished of Galba's officers
in the war, when once he had conceived the hope of succeeding him,
he eagerly indulged it. Most of the soldiers were on his side and
the Court supported him as Nero's double.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap14" id="Ichap14"></a><span class="chapnum">14</span>After receiving the news of the German revolt, although
Galba knew nothing for certain of Vitellius' <a name="page31" id="page31" ></a><span class="pagenum">31</span>plans, he was fearful
to what lengths the outbreak of the troops might go; so, being
unable to trust the troops in the <a name="fnm36" id="fnm36"></a>city,<a href="#fn36" class="fnnum">36</a> he had recourse to what
seemed his sole remedy and held an Imperial Election. Besides Vinius
and Laco he summoned Marius Celsus, consul-elect and the
City-Prefect Ducenius <a name="fnm37" id="fnm37"></a>Geminus.<a href="#fn37" class="fnnum">37</a> After prefacing a few words about
his own advanced age he ordered Piso <a name="fnm38" id="fnm38"></a>Licinianus<a href="#fn38" class="fnnum">38</a> to be sent for,
either on his own initiative, or, as some believed, at the instance
of Laco. Laco had met Piso at Rubellius Plautus' house and they had
formed a friendship, but he cunningly pretended that he was
supporting a stranger, and Piso's good repute gave colour to this
policy. Piso was a noble on both sides, being the son of Marcus
Crassus and Scribonia. There was an old-world austerity in his face
and bearing, and just critics spoke of his strict morality: people
who took a less favourable view thought him soured. But while those
who disliked this side of his character carped at it, it was a
recommendation in the eyes of the emperor who intended to adopt him.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap15" id="Ichap15"></a><span class="chapnum">15</span>Galba is said to have taken Piso's hand and addressed him
as follows: 'Were I a private citizen, and were I to adopt you in
the presence of the Priests <a name="page32" id="page32" ></a><span class="pagenum">32</span>by the usual formality of a curial
statute,<a name="fnm39" id="fnm39"></a><a href="#fn39" class="fnnum">39</a> it would be an honour for me to introduce into my
family a descendant of Cnaeus Pompeius and of Marcus Crassus, and
for you it would be a distinction to add to your noble ancestry the
glories of the Sulpician and Lutatian <a name="fnm40" id="fnm40"></a>houses.<a href="#fn40" class="fnnum">40</a> As it is, I have
been called by the consent of gods and men to be an emperor. Your
distinguished qualities and your patriotism have persuaded me to
offer to you peacefully and quietly the throne for which our
ancestors fought on the field of <a name="fnm41" id="fnm41"></a>battle,<a href="#fn41" class="fnnum">41</a> and which I too won by
war. In so doing I am following the precedent set by the sainted
Augustus, who raised to the rank next himself first his nephew
Marcellus, then his son-in-law Agrippa, then his daughter's
sons,<a name="fnm42" id="fnm42"></a><a href="#fn42" class="fnnum">42</a> and finally his stepson Tiberius Nero. However, while
Augustus looked for a successor in his own family, I have searched
throughout the country. Not that I lack either kinsmen or
supporters, but it was by no favour of birth that I myself came to
the throne, and, to prove my policy in this matter, consider how I
have passed over not only my own relatives but yours. <a name="page33" id="page33" ></a><span class="pagenum">33</span>You have an
elder <a name="fnm43" id="fnm43"></a>brother,<a href="#fn43" class="fnnum">43</a> as noble as yourself. He would have been worthy
of this position, but you are worthier. You are old enough to have
outlived youthful passions. Your life has been such that you have
nothing in your past to excuse. So far you have only experienced
misfortune. Prosperity probes the heart with a keener touch; misery
only calls for patience, but there is corruption in success.
Honesty, candour, and affection are the best of human qualities, and
doubtless you yourself have enough character to retain them. But the
complaisance of others will weaken your character. Flattery and
servile compliments will break down its defences and self-interest
too, the bane of all sincerity. What though you and I can talk
plainly with each other to-day? Others will address themselves not
to us but to our fortunes. To persuade an emperor what he ought to
do is a laborious task: any one can flatter him without a spark of
sincerity.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap16" id="Ichap16"></a><span class="chapnum">16</span>'If the vast bulk of this empire could stand and keep its
balance without a guiding hand, the Republic might well have dated
its birth from me. As it is, things have long ago come to such a
pass that neither I in my old age can give the Roman people any
better gift than a good successor, nor you in your prime anything
better than a good emperor. Under Tiberius, Caligula, and Claudius,
Rome was the heirloom of a single family. There is a kind of liberty
in the free choice we have begun to exercise. Now that the <a name="page34" id="page34" ></a><span class="pagenum">34</span>Julian
and Claudian houses are extinct, by the plan of adoption the best
man will always be discovered. Royal birth is the gift of fortune,
and is but valued as such. In adoption we can use a free judgement,
and if we wish to choose well, the voice of the country points the
way. Think of Nero, swollen with the pride of his long line of royal
ancestry. It was not Vindex with a powerless province at his back,
nor I with a single legion that freed Rome's shoulders of that
burden: it was his own cruelty and profligacy. And that was before
there was any precedent for the conviction of an emperor.</p>

<p>'We have been called to the throne by the swords of those who
thought us worthy. Our high state will not escape the eye of envy.
You may be sure of that. But there is no reason for you to feel
alarm because in this world-wide upheaval a couple of legions have
not yet settled down. I myself did not succeed to a safe and
peaceful throne, and, when once the news of your adoption is spread,
I shall cease to be charged with my advanced age, which is now the
only fault they find in me. The rascals will always miss Nero: you
and I have got to see that good citizens do not miss him too.</p>

<p>'A longer sermon would ill befit the time and I have fulfilled my
purpose, if I have done right in choosing you. The soundest and
easiest criterion of right and wrong policy is to consider what you
would have approved or condemned in another emperor. For Rome is not
like the nations which are ruled by kings, <a name="page35" id="page35" ></a><span class="pagenum">35</span>where one house is
supreme and the rest are slaves. Your future subjects are men who
cannot endure the extremes either of bondage or of freedom.'</p>

<p>Galba spoke these words and more to the same effect in the tone of
one creating an emperor: the rest addressed Piso as though he were
emperor already. <a name="Ichap17" id="Ichap17"></a><span class="chapnum">17</span>He is said to have betrayed no sign of
amazement or elation either before those who were then present, or
later when everybody's eyes centred upon him. His language to his
emperor and adoptive father was deeply respectful and he spoke
modestly of himself. He made no change in his expression or bearing,
showing himself more able than anxious to rule. A discussion then
took place whether the adoption should be announced before the
people or in the senate, or in the guards' camp. They decided in
favour of the camp, on the ground that it would be a compliment to
the troops, whose goodwill was hard to win by flattery or bribes,
but was by no means to be despised, if it could be won by good
means. Meanwhile the curiosity of the populace, impatient of any
important secret, had brought together crowds all round the Palace,
and when once the rumour began to leak out an attempt at suppression
only resulted in spreading it.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap18" id="Ichap18"></a><span class="chapnum">18</span>The tenth of January was a dreary wet day, and an
extraordinary storm of thunder and lightning showed the displeasure
of Providence. Such phenomena were regarded in old days as a sign
for the suspension of public business, but they did not deter Galba
from proceeding to the camp. Either he disregarded such <a name="page36" id="page36" ></a><span class="pagenum">36</span>things as
the result of pure chance or else he felt that the blows of fate may
be foretold but not forestalled. He addressed a crowded assembly of
the soldiers with true imperial brevity, stating simply that in
adopting Piso he was following the example of the sainted Augustus,
and the old military custom whereby each man chose <a name="fnm44" id="fnm44"></a>another.<a href="#fn44" class="fnnum">44</a> He
was afraid that by suppressing the news of the German rebellion he
might only seem to exaggerate the danger, so he voluntarily declared
that the Fourth and Twenty-second legions had been led by a few
traitors into seditious murmurings but no further, and would soon
return to their allegiance. He made no attempt to enhance his words
either by eloquence or largess. However, the tribunes and centurions
and those of the soldiers who stood nearest to him gave
well-sounding answers. The rest were sorry and silent, for the war
seemed to have lost them the largess that had always been usual even
in peace. Everybody agrees that they could have been won over had
the parsimonious old emperor made the least display of generosity.
He was ruined by his strict old-fashioned inflexibility, which seems
too rigorous for these degenerate days.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap19" id="Ichap19"></a><span class="chapnum">19</span>From the camp they proceeded to the senate, and Galba's
speech to its members was no fuller or finer than to the soldiers.
Piso spoke graciously, and there was no lack of support in the
senate. Many wished him well. Those who did not were the more
effusive. <a name="page37" id="page37" ></a><span class="pagenum">37</span>The majority were indifferent, but displayed a ready
affability, intent on their private speculations without thought of
the country's good. No other public action is reported of Piso
during the four days which intervened between his adoption and
assassination.</p>

<h3><a name="Galbas_Measures_of_Precaution" id="Galbas_Measures_of_Precaution"></a>Galba's Measures of Precaution</h3>

<p>Reports of the German rebellion grew daily more insistent and the
public was always ready to believe any news, provided it was bad.
Accordingly the senate decided that a commission must be sent to the
army in Germany. It was discussed in private whether Piso should go
himself to add dignity to the commission, since he could carry the
authority of the emperor, while the others represented the senate.
It was also proposed to send Laco, the prefect of the Guards, but he
objected. The senate had allowed Galba to nominate the commissioners
and he showed the most miserable indecision, now nominating members,
now excusing them, now making exchanges, yielding always to pressure
from people who wanted to go or to stay at home according as they
were determined by their hopes or their fears. <a name="Ichap20" id="Ichap20"></a><span class="chapnum">20</span>The next
question was one of finance. After investigating all possible
sources it seemed most reasonable to recover the revenue from those
quarters where the cause of the deficit lay. Nero had squandered in
lavish presents two thousand two hundred million <a name="fnm45" id="fnm45"></a>sesterces.<a href="#fn45" class="fnnum">45</a>
Galba gave instructions that these monies should be recovered from
<a name="page38" id="page38" ></a><span class="pagenum">38</span>the individual recipients, leaving each a tithe of their original
gift. However, in each case there was scarcely a tenth part left,
for these worthless spendthrifts had run through Nero's money as
freely as they had squandered their own: they had no real property
or capital left, nothing but the apparatus of their luxury. Thirty
of the knights were entrusted with the duty of recovering the money.
This commission, for which there was no precedent, proved vastly
unpopular owing to the scope of its authority, and the large number
of the victims. Every quarter seemed beset with sales and brokers
and lawsuits. And yet lively satisfaction was caused by the
discovery that the beneficiaries of Nero's bounty were as poor as
the victims of his greed.</p>

<p>At this time several officers were cashiered, Antonius Taurus and
Antonius Naso of the Guards, Aemilius Pacensis of the City Garrison,
and Julius Fronto of the <a name="fnm46" id="fnm46"></a>Police.<a href="#fn46" class="fnnum">46</a> However, this proved no remedy.
The others only began to feel alarmed, thinking that Galba's craft
and timidity had sacrificed a few, while his suspicions rested on
them all.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

</div>



<h3><a name="The_Rise_of_Otho" id="The_Rise_of_Otho"></a>The Rise of Otho</h3>

<p><a name="Ichap21" id="Ichap21"></a><span class="chapnum">21</span>Meanwhile Otho had nothing to hope from a peaceful
settlement: all his plans demanded a disturbance. Many motives
spurred him on: his extravagance would have ruined a prince, and his
poverty have perplexed a private person: he was angry with Galba and
jealous <a name="page39" id="page39" ></a><span class="pagenum">39</span>of Piso. He also alleged fears for his safety, by way of
whetting his ambition. 'I proved a nuisance to Nero,' he would say,
'and can scarcely expect the compliment of a second exile to
Lusitania.<a name="fnm47" id="fnm47"></a><a href="#fn47" class="fnnum">47</a> Besides, monarchs always hate and suspect the man who
is mentioned as "next to the throne". This was what did me harm with
the old emperor, and it will weigh still more with the youthful
Piso, who is naturally savage and has been exasperated by a long
period of exile. It would be easy to kill me. I must do and dare
while Galba's authority is on the wane and Piso's not yet
established. These times of change suit big enterprises; inaction is
more deadly than daring; there is no call for delay. Death is the
natural end for all alike, and the only difference is between fame
and oblivion afterwards. Seeing that the same end awaits the
innocent and the guilty, a man of spirit should at least deserve his
fate.'</p>

<p><a name="Ichap22" id="Ichap22"></a><span class="chapnum">22</span>Otho's character was by no means so effeminate as his
person. His intimate freedmen and slaves, who were allowed a licence
unusual in private households, dangled before him the baits for
which he was greedy: the luxuries of Nero's Court, the marriages he
could make, the adulteries he could commit, and all the other
imperial pleasures. They were his, they pointed out, if he would
bestir himself; it was shameful to lie quiet and leave them to
others. He was also incited by the astrologers, who declared that
their study of the stars pointed to great changes and a year <a name="page40" id="page40" ></a><span class="pagenum">40</span>of
glory for Otho. Creatures of this class always deceive the
ambitious, though those in power distrust them. Probably we shall go
on for ever proscribing them and keeping them by <a name="fnm48" id="fnm48"></a>us.<a href="#fn48" class="fnnum">48</a> <a name="fnm49" id="fnm49"></a>Poppaea<a href="#fn49" class="fnnum">49</a>
had always had her boudoir full of these astrologers, the worst kind
of outfit for a royal m&eacute;nage. One of them, called Ptolemy, had gone
with Otho to <a name="fnm50" id="fnm50"></a>Spain<a href="#fn50" class="fnnum">50</a> and foretold that he would outlive Nero. This
came true and Otho believed in him. He now based his vague
conjectures on the computations of Galba's age and Otho's youth, and
persuaded him that he would ascend the throne. But, though the man
had no real skill, Otho accepted the prophecy as if it was the
finger of fate. Human nature always likes to believe what it cannot
understand.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap23" id="Ichap23"></a><span class="chapnum">23</span>Nor was Ptolemy himself slow to incite his master to crime,
to which it is only a short step from such ambitions. But whether
his criminal designs were deliberate or suddenly conceived, it is
impossible to say. He had long been courting the goodwill of the
soldiers either in the hope of being adopted by Galba or to prepare
the way for treason. On the road from Spain, while the men were
marching or on outpost duty, he would address the veterans by name,
reminding them how he and they had served together under Nero, and
calling them his comrades. He renewed acquaintance <a name="page41" id="page41" ></a><span class="pagenum">41</span>with some, asked
after others and helped them with money or influence, frequently
letting fall complaints and ambiguous remarks about Galba, using all
the arts which work upon uneducated minds. The soldiers grumbled
bitterly at the exertions of the march, the shortage of provisions,
and the strict discipline. What they were used to was a journey to
the Campanian Lakes or Greek seaports on board ship;<a name="fnm51" id="fnm51"></a><a href="#fn51" class="fnnum">51</a> they found
it hard to struggle over the Pyrenees and Alps, and march immense
distances under arms.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap24" id="Ichap24"></a><span class="chapnum">24</span>While the soldiers were thus already fired with discontent,
Maevius Pudens, one of Tigellinus'<a name="fnm52" id="fnm52"></a><a href="#fn52" class="fnnum">52</a> intimates, added fuel to
their feelings by luring on all who were naturally unstable or in
need of money, or rashly eager for a change. Eventually, whenever
Galba dined with him, Otho went the length of presenting a hundred
sesterces to each of the soldiers on guard, on the pretext that this
was instead of entertaining <a name="fnm53" id="fnm53"></a>them.<a href="#fn53" class="fnnum">53</a> This system of public largess
Otho extended by making presents in confidence to individuals, and
such spirit did he show in bribery that when a member of the Body
Guard, Cocceius Proculus, brought an action to <a name="page42" id="page42" ></a><span class="pagenum">42</span>claim part of his
neighbour's farm, Otho bought the whole property out of his own
pocket and gave it to him. He was enabled to do this by the
inefficiency of the Prefect Laco, who was no less blind to notorious
than to secret scandals.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap25" id="Ichap25"></a><span class="chapnum">25</span>Otho then put Onomastus, one of his freedmen, in charge of
the projected crime, and Onomastus took into his confidence Barbius
Proculus, an aide-de-camp, and a subaltern named Veturius, both in
the Body <a name="fnm54" id="fnm54"></a>Guard.<a href="#fn54" class="fnnum">54</a> Having assured himself by many interviews that
they were both bold and cunning, Otho proceeded to load them with
bribes and promises, providing them with funds to enable them to
test the feelings of the others. And so a couple of common soldiers
took it upon them to transfer the Roman Empire: and they did it. A
very few were admitted as accomplices. These, by various devices,
worked on the indecision of the others. The non-commissioned
officers who had been promoted by Nymphidius felt themselves under
suspicion; the private soldiers were indignant and in despair at the
constant postponement of Galba's largess; some few were fired by the
recollection of Nero's r&eacute;gime and longed for the days of licence;
all in common shared the fear of being drafted out of the Praetorian
Guards.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap26" id="Ichap26"></a><span class="chapnum">26</span>The infection of treason soon spread to the legions <a name="page43" id="page43" ></a><span class="pagenum">43</span>and
auxiliaries, whose excitement had been aroused as soon as they heard
that the armies of Germany were wavering in their allegiance. So, as
the disloyal were ready for treason and the loyal shut their eyes,
they at first determined to acclaim Otho as he was returning from
dinner on the night of the fourteenth. However, they hesitated: the
darkness spelt uncertainty, the troops were scattered all over the
town, and unanimity could scarcely be expected from drunken men.
They were not deterred by any affection for their country's honour,
which they were deliberately preparing to stain with its emperor's
blood, but they were afraid that, as Otho was unknown to the
majority, some one else might by mistake be offered to the Pannonian
or German legions and proclaimed emperor. Some evidence of the
brewing plot leaked out, but it was suppressed by the conspirators.
Rumours even reached Galba's ears, but Laco made light of them,
being totally ignorant of soldiers' characters, hostile to any
suggestion, however wise, that was not his own, and extremely
obstinate with men who knew more than he did.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap27" id="Ichap27"></a><span class="chapnum">27</span>On January 15, as Galba was sacrificing in front of the
temple of Apollo, the priest Umbricius declared the omens
unfavourable: treason was impending, and an enemy within the walls.
Otho, who was standing beside Galba, overheard and construed the
omen as being from his own point of view a good one, favourable to
his plans. In a few moments his freedman, Onomastus, announced that
the architect and contractors were waiting to see him. This had been
agreed <a name="page44" id="page44" ></a><span class="pagenum">44</span>upon as the signal that the troops were assembling and the
conspiracy was ripe. On being asked where he was going, Otho
pretended that he was buying an old property, but suspected its
condition and so had to inspect it first. Thus, leaning on his
freedman's shoulder, he passed through Tiberius' house into the
Velabrum and thence to the Golden Milestone at the foot of the
Temple of <a name="fnm55" id="fnm55"></a>Saturn.<a href="#fn55" class="fnnum">55</a> There thirty-three soldiers of the Body Guard
saluted him as emperor. When he showed alarm at the smallness of
their number they put him hastily into a litter, and, drawing their
swords, hurried him away. About the same number of soldiers joined
them on the way, some accomplices, others merely curious. Some
marched along shouting and flourishing swords; others kept silent,
intending to take their cue from subsequent events.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap28" id="Ichap28"></a><span class="chapnum">28</span>Julius Martialis was the tribune on duty in the camp. He
was so overcome by the magnitude of this unexpected crime and so
afraid that the treason was widespread in the camp, and that he
might be killed if he offered any opposition, that he led most
people to suppose he was in the plot. So, too, the other tribunes
and centurions all preferred present safety to a risky loyalty. In
fact the general attitude was this: few dared to undertake so foul a
crime, many wished to see it done, and everybody was ready to
condone it.</p>

<h3><a name="The_Fall_of_Galba" id="The_Fall_of_Galba"></a>The Fall of Galba</h3>

<p><a name="Ichap29" id="Ichap29"></a><span class="chapnum">29</span>Meanwhile Galba in total ignorance and intent upon his
sacrifices continued to importune the gods of an empire that had
already ceased to be his. First there came a rumour that some one or
other of the senators was being hurried to the camp, then that it
was Otho. Immediately people who had met Otho came flocking in from
all quarters of Rome; some in their terror exaggerated the truth,
some minimized it, remembering even then to flatter. After
discussion it was decided that the temper of the cohort on guard in
the palace should be tested, but not by Galba himself. His authority
was held in reserve for more heroic remedies. The troops were
summoned. Piso, standing out on the steps of the palace, addressed
them as follows:</p>

<p>'Fellow soldiers, it is now five days since I was made a Caesar. I
knew nothing of the future nor whether the name was more to be
desired or feared. It now lies with you to decide whether or no my
adoption is to prove a calamity for my house and for my country. In
saying this, I do not dread disaster on my own account. I have known
misfortune, and I am now discovering to the full that prosperity is
just as dangerous. But for the sake of my adoptive father, of the
senate, and of the whole empire, I deplore the thought that we may
have to-day either to die or&mdash;what for good men is as wretched&mdash;to
kill. In the recent revolution our comfort was that Rome was spared
the sight of blood, and the transfer was effected <a name="page46" id="page46" ></a><span class="pagenum">46</span>without
disturbance. We thought that my adoption would be a safeguard
against an outbreak of civil war even after Galba's death.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap30" id="Ichap30"></a><span class="chapnum">30</span>'I will make no claims to rank or respectability. To
compare myself with Otho, I need not recite my virtues. His vices
are all he has to be proud of. They ruined the empire, even when he
was only playing the part of an emperor's friend. Why should he
deserve to be emperor? For his swaggering demeanour? For his
effeminate costume? Extravagance imposes on some people. They take
it for liberality. They are wrong. He will know how to squander
money, but not how to give it away. His mind is full of lechery and
debauchery and intrigues with women. These are in his eyes the
prerogatives of the throne. And the pleasure of his vices would be
all his, the blushes of shame would be ours. No man has ever ruled
well who won the throne by bad means.</p>

<p>'The whole Roman world agreed to give Galba the title of Caesar.
Galba with your approval gave that title to me. Even if the
"country", the "senate", the "people", are empty terms, it is to
your interest, my fellow soldiers, to see that it is not the rascals
who create an emperor. From time to time one hears of the
legionaries being in mutiny against their generals. But your good
faith and your good name have stood to this day unimpaired. It was
not you who deserted Nero: he deserted you. Are you going to allow
less than thirty deserters and renegades to bestow the crown? Why!
no one would tolerate their choosing <a name="page47" id="page47" ></a><span class="pagenum">47</span>so much as a centurion or a
tribune for themselves. Are you going to allow this precedent, and
by your acquiescence make their crime your own? You will soon see
this lawless spirit spreading to the troops abroad, and in time the
treason will recoil on us and the war on you. Besides, innocence
wins you as much as the murder of your emperor: you will get from us
as large a bounty for your loyalty as you would from others for your
crime.'</p>

<p><a name="Ichap31" id="Ichap31"></a><span class="chapnum">31</span>The members of the Body Guard dispersed. The rest of the
cohort paid some heed to his speech. Aimlessly, as happens in
moments of confusion, they seized their standards, without as yet
any fixed plan, and not, as was afterwards believed, to cloak their
treachery. Marius Celsus had been dispatched to the picked
detachments of the Illyrian army, which were quartered in the
Vipsanian <a name="fnm56" id="fnm56"></a>arcade,<a href="#fn56" class="fnnum">56</a> while instructions had been given to two
senior <a name="fnm57" id="fnm57"></a>centurions,<a href="#fn57" class="fnnum">57</a> Amullius Serenus and Domitius Sabinus, to
summon the German troops from the Hall of Liberty. They distrusted
the legion of marines, who had been alienated by Galba's <a name="page48" id="page48" ></a><span class="pagenum">48</span>butchery
of their comrades on his entry into <a name="fnm58" id="fnm58"></a>Rome.<a href="#fn58" class="fnnum">58</a> Three officers of the
guards, Cetrius Severus, Subrius Dexter, and Pompeius Longinus, also
hurried to the camp in the hope that the mutiny was still in its
early stages and might be averted by good advice before it came to a
head. The soldiers attacked Subrius and Cetrius with threats and
forcibly seizing Longinus disarmed him, because he had not come in
virtue of his military rank, but simply as one of Galba's private
friends; and for his loyalty to his master the rebels disliked him
all the more. The marines without any hesitation joined the guards.
The Illyrian <a name="fnm59" id="fnm59"></a>draft<a href="#fn59" class="fnnum">59</a> drove Celsus away at the point of their
javelins. The German detachments<a href="#fn59" class="fnnum">59</a> wavered for some time. They
were still in poor condition physically, and inclined to be passive.
Nero had dispatched them as an advance-guard to Alexandria;<a name="fnm60" id="fnm60"></a><a href="#fn60" class="fnnum">60</a> the
long voyage back again had damaged their health, and Galba had
spared no expense in looking after them.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap32" id="Ichap32"></a><span class="chapnum">32</span>The whole populace of Rome was now crowding into the palace
together with a good sprinkling of slaves. With discordant shouts
they demanded the death of Otho and the doom of the conspirators.
They might have been in the circus or the theatre, clamouring for
entertainment. There was neither sense nor sincerity in their
behaviour. They were quite ready on the same day to clamour for the
opposite with equal zeal. <a name="page49" id="page49" ></a><span class="pagenum">49</span>But it is an established custom to
flatter any emperor with unbridled cheering and meaningless
enthusiasm. Meanwhile Galba was torn between two opinions. Titus
Vinius maintained that they ought to remain within the palace,
employ the slaves to offer resistance and block up all the doors,
instead of going out to face the angry troops. 'This will give
time,' he urged, 'for the disloyal to repent and the loyal to unite
their forces. Crimes demand haste, good counsels profit by delay.
Besides, if need be, we shall have the same chance of leaving the
palace later: if we leave and repent of it, it will not be in our
power to return.'</p>

<p><a name="Ichap33" id="Ichap33"></a><span class="chapnum">33</span>All the others voted for immediate action before the
conspiracy gathered strength and numbers. 'Otho,' they argued, 'will
soon lose heart. He crept away by stealth and was introduced in a
litter to a parcel of strangers, and now because we dally and waste
time he has leisure to rehearse his part of emperor. What is the
good of waiting until Otho sets his camp in order and approaches the
Capitol, while Galba peeps out of a window? Are this famous general
and his gallant friends to shut the doors and not to stir a foot
over the threshold, as if they were anxious to endure a siege? Much
help may we hope from slaves, when once the unwieldy crowd loses its
unity and their first indignation, which counts for so much, begins
to cool. No, cowardice is too risky. Or if we must fall, let us meet
the danger half-way, and cover Otho with disgrace, ourselves with
honour.'</p>

<p><a name="page50" id="page50" ></a><span class="pagenum">50</span>When Vinius resisted this proposal, Laco, prompted by Icelus,
assailed him with threats, persisting in his private quarrel to the
ruin of his country. <a name="Ichap34" id="Ichap34"></a><span class="chapnum">34</span>Galba without further delay supported
those whose plan would look best. However, Piso was first dispatched
to the camp. The young man had a great name, his popularity was
still fresh, and moreover, he disliked Titus Vinius, or, if he did
not, Vinius' enemies hoped he did: it is so easy to believe in
hatred. Scarcely had Piso departed, when there arrived a rumour that
Otho had been killed in the camp. At first it was vague and
uncertain, but eventually, as so often happens with daring lies,
people began to assert that they had been present and seen the deed.
Some were glad and some indifferent, so the news gained easy
credence. Many, however, thought that the report had been concocted
and disseminated by friends of Otho, who now mingled in the crowd
and tried to lure Galba out by spreading this agreeable falsehood.
<a name="Ichap35" id="Ichap35"></a><span class="chapnum">35</span>At this point not only the populace and the inexperienced
mob but many of the knights and senators as well broke out into
applause and unbridled enthusiasm. With their fear they had lost
their caution. Breaking open the palace gates they rushed in and
presented themselves before Galba, complaining that they had been
forestalled in the task of revenge. All the cowards who, as events
proved, could show no pluck in action, indulged in excessive heroics
and lip-courage. Nobody knew, everybody talked. At last, for lack of
the truth, Galba yielded to the consensus of error. When he had put
on his <a name="page51" id="page51" ></a><span class="pagenum">51</span>breastplate he was lifted into a chair, for he was too old
and infirm to stand against the crowds that kept flocking in. In the
palace he was met by Julius Atticus, of the Body Guard, who
displayed a dripping sword and shouted out that he had killed Otho.
'Comrade,' said Galba, 'who bade you?' Galba had a remarkable power
of curbing soldiers' presumption, for he was not afraid of threats
nor moved by flattery.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap36" id="Ichap36"></a><span class="chapnum">36</span>Meanwhile in Otho's camp there was no longer any doubt of
the soldiers' unanimity. Such was their enthusiasm that they were
not content with carrying Otho shoulder-high in procession; they
placed him among the standards on the platform, where shortly before
a gilt statue of Galba had stood, and made a ring round him with
their <a name="fnm61" id="fnm61"></a>colours.<a href="#fn61" class="fnnum">61</a> Tribunes and centurions were allowed no approach:
the common soldiers even called out, 'Beware of the officers.' The
whole camp resounded with confused shouts of mutual encouragement.
It was quite unlike the wavering and spiritless flattery of a civil
mob. As new adherents streamed in, directly a soldier caught sight
of one of them, he grasped him by the hand, flung his arms round
him, kept him at his side, and dictated the oath of allegiance. Some
commended their general to his soldiers, and some the soldiers to
their general. Otho, for his part, was not slow to greet the crowd
with outstretched hand and throw kisses to them. In every way he
played the slave to gain a throne. When <a name="page52" id="page52" ></a><span class="pagenum">52</span>the whole legion of the
marines had sworn allegiance, he gained confidence in his strength,
and, considering that those whom he had incited individually needed
a few words of general encouragement, he stood out on the rampart
and began as follows:&mdash;<a name="Ichap37" id="Ichap37"></a><span class="chapnum">37</span>'In what guise I come forward to
address you, Fellow Soldiers, I cannot tell. Dubbed emperor by you,
I dare not call myself a private citizen: yet "emperor" I cannot say
with another on the throne. And what am I to call you? That too will
remain in doubt until it is decided whether you have here in your
camp an enemy or an emperor of Rome. You hear how they clamour at
once for my death and your punishment. So clear is it that we must
fall or stand together. Doubtless Galba&mdash;such is his clemency&mdash;has
already promised our destruction. Is he not the man who without the
least excuse butchered thousands of utterly innocent <a name="fnm62" id="fnm62"></a>soldiers?<a href="#fn62" class="fnnum">62</a> I
shudder whenever I recall his ghastly entry into the city, when
before the face of Rome he ordered the decimation of the troops whom
at their humble petition he had taken under his protection. That is
Galba's only "victory". These were the auspices under which he made
his entry; and what glory has he brought to the throne he occupies,
save the murder of Obultronius Sabinus and Cornelius Marcellus in
Spain, of Betuus Cilo in Gaul, of Fonteius Capito in Germany, of
Clodius Macer in Africa, of Cingonius on his march to Rome, of
Turpilianus in the city, and of Nymphidius in the camp? What
<a name="page53" id="page53" ></a><span class="pagenum">53</span>province is there in the empire that has not been polluted with
massacre? He calls it "salutary correction". For his "remedies" are
what other people call crimes: his cruelty is disguised as
"austerity", his avarice as "economy", while by "discipline" he
means punishing and insulting you. It is but seven months since
Nero's death, and already Icelus alone has embezzled more than all
the depredations of Polyclitus and Vatinius and <a name="fnm63" id="fnm63"></a>Aegialus<a href="#fn63" class="fnnum">63</a> put
together. Why, Vinius would have been less greedy and lawless had he
been emperor himself. As it is, he treats us as his own subjects and
despises us as Galba's. His own fortune alone could provide the
largess which they daily cast in your teeth but never pay into your
pocket.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap38" id="Ichap38"></a><span class="chapnum">38</span>'Nor in Galba's successor either is there any hope for you.
Galba has seen to that. He has recalled from exile the man whose
avarice and sour temper he judged most like his own. You witnessed
for yourselves, my comrades, the extraordinary storm which signified
Heaven's abhorrence at that ill-starred adoption. The Senate and
People of Rome feel the same. They are counting on your courage. You
alone can give strength to the right policy: it is powerless without
you, however good it be. It is <a name="page54" id="page54" ></a><span class="pagenum">54</span>not to war and danger that I call
you. All the troops are with us. That single plain-clothes
<a name="fnm64" id="fnm64"></a>cohort<a href="#fn64" class="fnnum">64</a> is no longer a defence to Galba, but a hindrance. When
once they have caught sight of you, when once they come to take
their orders from me, the only quarrel between you will be who can
do most to put me in their debt. There is no room for delay in plans
which cannot be commended until they are put into action.'</p>

<p>Otho then gave orders to open the arsenal. The soldiers immediately
seized their arms in such haste that all the ordinary distinctions
of the service were neglected: neither Guards nor Legionaries
carried their own arms:<a name="fnm65" id="fnm65"></a><a href="#fn65" class="fnnum">65</a> in the confusion they took the helmets
and shields of the auxiliaries. There were no tribunes or centurions
to encourage them: each man followed his own lead, and the rascals
found their chief incentive in the consternation of the loyal.
<a name="Ichap39" id="Ichap39"></a><span class="chapnum">39</span>As the riot increased, Piso, alarmed by the din of their
shouts, which could be heard even in the city, had overtaken Galba,
who had meanwhile left the palace and was approaching the Forum.
Marius Celsus had also brought back no good news. Some were for
returning to the palace, others for seeking the shelter of the
Capitol, many for seizing the Rostra. The majority merely disagreed
with other people's proposals, and, as so often happens <a name="page55" id="page55" ></a><span class="pagenum">55</span>in these
disasters, the best course always seemed the one for which it was
now too late. It is said that Laco, without Galba's knowledge,
proposed the assassination of Titus Vinius, either with the idea
that his execution would be a sop to the soldiers, or because he
believed him Otho's accomplice, or, as a last alternative, hatred
may have been his motive. However, the time and the place both bred
scruples; when killing once begins it is difficult to set a limit:
besides, their plans were upset by the arrival of terrified
messengers, by the continual desertion of their supporters, and by a
general waning of enthusiasm even among those who at first had been
the keenest to display their loyalty and courage.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap40" id="Ichap40"></a><span class="chapnum">40</span>Galba was driven hither and thither by the tide of the
surging mob. The temples and public <a name="fnm66" id="fnm66"></a>buildings<a href="#fn66" class="fnnum">66</a> were crowded with
spectators, who viewed a sorry scene. No shouts came from the crowd:
astonishment was on their faces, and their ears open to every sound.
There was neither uproar nor quiet, but the silence of strong
emotion and alarm. However, a report reached Otho that the populace
was arming. He bade his men fly headlong to forestall the danger.
Off went the Roman soldiers as if they were going to drag Vologaesus
or Pacorus from the ancestral throne of the <a name="fnm67" id="fnm67"></a>Arsacids<a href="#fn67" class="fnnum">67</a>&mdash;and not to
butcher their own emperor, <a name="page56" id="page56" ></a><span class="pagenum">56</span>a helpless old man. Armed to the teeth,
they broke at a full gallop into the Forum, scattering the populace
and trampling senators under foot. Neither the sight of the Capitol
nor the sanctity of the temples towering above them, nor the thought
of Roman emperors past and to come, could avail to deter them from
committing that crime which the next successor always avenges.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap41" id="Ichap41"></a><span class="chapnum">41</span>Seeing the armed ranks now close at hand, the
standard-bearer of the cohort on guard over <a name="fnm68" id="fnm68"></a>Galba<a href="#fn68" class="fnnum">68</a>&mdash;tradition
says his name was Atilius Vergilio&mdash;tore off the medallion of
<a name="fnm69" id="fnm69"></a>Galba<a href="#fn69" class="fnnum">69</a> and flung it to the ground. This signal clearly showed
that all the troops were for Otho: the people fled from the deserted
Forum and swords were drawn against any who lingered. Near 'Lake
Curtius'<a name="fnm70" id="fnm70"></a><a href="#fn70" class="fnnum">70</a> Galba was precipitated from his chair by the
panic-stricken haste of the bearers and flung to the ground. The
accounts of his last words vary according as they are prompted by
hatred or admiration. Some say that he whined and asked what harm he
had deserved, begging for a few days' respite to pay the troops
their largess. The majority say that he offered his neck to the blow
and bade them, 'Come, strike, if it serves the country's need.'
Whatever he said mattered little to his assassins. As to the actual
<a name="page57" id="page57" ></a><span class="pagenum">57</span>murderer there is a difference of opinion. Some say it was
Terentius, a <a name="fnm71" id="fnm71"></a>reservist,<a href="#fn71" class="fnnum">71</a> others that his name was Laecanius. The
most common account is that a soldier of the Fifteenth legion, by
name Camurius, pierced his throat with a sword-thrust. The others
foully mangled his arms and legs (his breast was covered) and with
bestial savagery continued to stab the headless corpse.
<a name="Ichap42" id="Ichap42"></a><span class="chapnum">42</span>Then they made for Titus Vinius. Here, too, there is a
doubt whether the fear of imminent death strangled his voice, or
whether he called out that they had no mandate from Otho to kill
him. He may have invented this in his terror, or it may have been a
confession of his complicity in the plot. His whole life and
reputation give reason to suppose that he was an accomplice in the
crime of which he was the cause. He was brought to the ground in
front of the temple of Julius by a blow on the knee, and afterwards
a common soldier named Julius Carus ran him through with a sword.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap43" id="Ichap43"></a><span class="chapnum">43</span>However, Rome found one hero that day. This was Sempronius
Densus, a centurion of the Guards, who had been told off by Galba to
protect Piso. Drawing his dagger he faced the armed assassins,
flinging their treason in their teeth, and by his shouts and
gestures turned their attention upon himself, thus enabling <a name="page58" id="page58" ></a><span class="pagenum">58</span>Piso to
escape despite his wounds. Piso, reaching the temple of Vesta, was
mercifully sheltered by the verger, who hid him in his lodging.
There, no reverence for this sanctuary but merely his concealment
postponed his immediate death. Eventually, Otho, who was burning to
have him <a name="fnm72" id="fnm72"></a>killed,<a href="#fn72" class="fnnum">72</a> dispatched as special agents, Sulpicius Florus
of the British cohorts, a man whom Galba had recently enfranchised,
and Statius Murcus of the Body Guard. They dragged Piso forth and
butchered him on the threshold of the temple.</p>

<h3><a name="Otho_on_the_Throne" id="Otho_on_the_Throne"></a>Otho on the Throne</h3>

<p><a name="Ichap44" id="Ichap44"></a><span class="chapnum">44</span>None of his murders pleased Otho so much as this. On Piso's
head, as on no other, they say, he gazed with insatiable eyes. This
was possibly the first moment at which he felt relieved of all
anxiety, and free to indulge his glee; or perhaps, in the case of
Galba and of Vinius, the recollection of his treason to the one and
of his former friendship with the other troubled even his unfeeling
heart with gloomy thoughts, whereas, Piso being an enemy and a
rival, he considered it a pious duty to gloat over his murder. Their
heads were fixed on poles and carried along with the standards of
the cohorts side by side with the eagle of the <a name="fnm73" id="fnm73"></a>legion.<a href="#fn73" class="fnnum">73</a> Those who
had done the deed and those who had witnessed it vied with each
other in displaying their bloody hands, all boasting of their
share&mdash;some falsely, <a name="page59" id="page59" ></a><span class="pagenum">59</span>some truly&mdash;as if it were a fine and memorable
exploit. Vitellius subsequently discovered more than 120 petitions
demanding rewards for distinguished services rendered on that day.
He gave orders to search out all the petitioners and put them to
death. This was from no respect for Galba: he merely followed the
traditional custom by which princes secure their present safety and
posthumous vengeance.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap45" id="Ichap45"></a><span class="chapnum">45</span>The senate and people seemed different men. There was a
general rush for the camp, every one shouldering his neighbour and
trying to overtake those in front. They heaped insults on Galba,
praised the prudence of the troops, and covered Otho's hand with
kisses, their extravagance varying inversely with their sincerity.
Otho rebuffed no one, and succeeded by his words and looks in
moderating the menace of the soldiers' greed for vengeance. They
loudly demanded the execution of Marius Celsus, the consul-elect,
who had remained Galba's faithful friend to the last. They were as
much offended at his efficiency and honesty as if these had been
criminal qualities. What they wanted was obviously to find a first
excuse for plunder and murder and the destruction of all decent
citizens. But Otho had as yet no influence to prevent crimes: he
could only order them. So he simulated anger, giving instructions
for Celsus' arrest, and by promising that he should meet with a
worse penalty, thus rescued him from immediate death.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap46" id="Ichap46"></a><span class="chapnum">46</span>The will of the soldiers was now henceforward supreme. The
Praetorian Guards chose their own <a name="page60" id="page60" ></a><span class="pagenum">60</span>prefects, Plotius Firmus, a man
who had risen from the ranks to the post of Chief of <a name="fnm74" id="fnm74"></a>Police,<a href="#fn74" class="fnnum">74</a> and
joined Otho's side before Galba's fall, and Licinius Proculus, an
intimate friend of Otho, and therefore suspected of furthering his
plans. They made Flavius <a name="fnm75" id="fnm75"></a>Sabinus<a href="#fn75" class="fnnum">75</a> prefect of the city, therein
following Nero's choice, under whom Sabinus had held that post;
besides, most of them had an eye to the fact that he was Vespasian's
brother. An urgent demand arose that the customary fees to
centurions for granting furlough should be abolished, for they
constituted a sort of annual tax upon the common soldier. The result
had been that a quarter of each company could go off on leave or
lounge idly about the barracks, so long as they paid the centurion
his fee, nor was there any one to control either the amount of this
impost or the means by which the soldiers raised the money: highway
robbery or menial service was the usual resort whereby they
purchased leisure. Then, again, a soldier who had money was savagely
burdened with work until he should buy exemption. Thus he soon
became impoverished and enervated by idleness, and returned to his
company no longer a man of means and energy but penniless and lazy.
So the process went on. One after another they became deteriorated
by poverty and lax discipline, rushing blindly into quarrels and
<a name="page61" id="page61" ></a><span class="pagenum">61</span>mutiny, and, as a last resource, into civil war. Otho was afraid of
alienating the centurions by his concessions to the rank and file,
and promised to pay the annual furlough-fees out of his private
purse. This was indubitably a sound reform, which good emperors have
since established as a regular custom in the army. The prefect Laco
he pretended to banish to an island, but on his arrival he was
stabbed by a <a name="fnm76" id="fnm76"></a>reservist<a href="#fn76" class="fnnum">76</a> whom Otho had previously dispatched for
that purpose. Marcianus Icelus, as being one of his own
freedmen,<a name="fnm77" id="fnm77"></a><a href="#fn77" class="fnnum">77</a> he sentenced to public execution.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap47" id="Ichap47"></a><span class="chapnum">47</span>Thus the day was spent in crimes, and worst of all was the
joy they caused. The senate was summoned by the urban <a name="fnm78" id="fnm78"></a>praetor.<a href="#fn78" class="fnnum">78</a>
The other magistrates all vied in flattery. The senators arrived
post-haste. They decreed to Otho the powers of the tribunate, the
title of Augustus, and all the imperial prerogatives. Their
unanimous object was to blot out all recollection of former insults;
but, as these had been hurled equally from all sides, they did not,
as far as any one could see, stick in his memory. Whether he had
forgotten them or only postponed punishment, his reign was too short
to show. He was then carried through the still reeking Forum among
the piles of dead bodies to the Capitol, and thence to the palace.
He granted permission to burn and bury the bodies of his victims.
<a name="page62" id="page62" ></a><span class="pagenum">62</span>Piso's wife Verania and his brother Scribonianus laid out his body,
and this was done for Vinius by his daughter Crispina. They had to
search for the heads and buy them back from the murderers, who had
preserved them for sale.</p>

<h3><a name="Dramatis_Personae" id="Dramatis_Personae"></a>Dramatis Personae</h3>

<p><a name="Ichap48" id="Ichap48"></a><span class="chapnum">48</span>Piso was in his thirty-first year. His reputation was
better than his fortune. His brothers had been executed, Magnus by
Claudius, Crassus by <a name="fnm79" id="fnm79"></a>Nero.<a href="#fn79" class="fnnum">79</a> He himself after being long in exile
was a Caesar for four days. Hastily adopted in preference to his
elder <a name="fnm80" id="fnm80"></a>brother,<a href="#fn80" class="fnnum">80</a> the only advantage he reaped was to be killed
first.</p>

<p>Titus Vinius in his fifty-seven years had displayed strange
contrasts of character. His father belonged to a family of
praetorian rank; his mother's father was one of the <a name="fnm81" id="fnm81"></a>proscribed.<a href="#fn81" class="fnnum">81</a>
A scandal marked his first military service under the general
Calvisius <a name="fnm82" id="fnm82"></a>Sabinus.<a href="#fn82" class="fnnum">82</a> The general's wife suffered from a suspicious
desire to inspect the arrangements of the camp, which she entered by
night disguised in soldier's uniform. There she brazenly interfered
with the guard and the soldiers on duty, and eventually had the
effrontery <a name="page63" id="page63" ></a><span class="pagenum">63</span>to commit adultery in the general's own quarters. The
man convicted of implication in this scandal was Titus Vinius. He
was therefore put in irons by order of <a name="fnm83" id="fnm83"></a>Caligula.<a href="#fn83" class="fnnum">83</a> However, the
fortunes of the time soon changed and he was set at liberty. After
mounting the ladder of office without check, he was as an ex-praetor
given the command of a legion, and proved successful. But soon again
he soiled his reputation, and laid himself under the charge of
having been mean enough to steal a gold cup from Claudius'
dinner-table. Claudius gave orders that on the next day Vinius alone
of all his guests should be served on earthenware. However, as
pro-consul, Vinius' government of Narbonese Gaul was strict and
honest. Subsequently his friendship with Galba brought him into
danger. He was bold, cunning, and efficient, with great power for
good or for evil, according to his mood. Vinius' will was annulled
because of his great wealth. Piso was poor, so his last wishes were
respected.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap49" id="Ichap49"></a><span class="chapnum">49</span>Galba's body lay long neglected, and under cover of
darkness was subjected to various insults. Eventually his steward
Argius, one of his former slaves, gave it a humble burial in his
private garden. His head, which the camp-followers and servants had
mangled and carried on a pole, was found next day in front of the
tomb of Patrobius (one of Nero's freedmen whom Galba had executed)
and buried with the body which had already been cremated. Such was
the end of <a name="page64" id="page64" ></a><span class="pagenum">64</span>Servius Galba, who for seventy-three years had enjoyed
prosperity under five different emperors, happier in their reign
than his own. He came of an old and noble family and possessed great
wealth. His own character was mediocre, rather free from vices than
rich in virtues. Though not indifferent to fame, he did not court it
by advertisement. Not greedy of other people's money, he was careful
of his own, and a miser with public funds. His attitude towards
friends and freedmen, if they were honest, was one of kindly
complaisance; when they were not, he was culpably blind. But his
distinguished origin and the peculiar perils of the time disguised
his apathy, which passed as <a name="fnm84" id="fnm84"></a>prudence.<a href="#fn84" class="fnnum">84</a> In the flower of his youth
he served with distinction in Germany. As pro-consul he governed
Africa wisely, and in later years showed the same equity in Nearer
Spain.<a name="fnm85" id="fnm85"></a><a href="#fn85" class="fnnum">85</a> When he was a commoner he seemed too big for his station,
and had he never been emperor, no one would have doubted his ability
to reign.</p>

<h3><a name="The_Rise_of_Vitellius" id="The_Rise_of_Vitellius"></a>The Rise of Vitellius</h3>

<p><a name="Ichap50" id="Ichap50"></a><span class="chapnum">50</span>The city was in a panic. The alarm aroused by the recent
atrocious crime and by Otho's well-known proclivities was further
increased by the fresh news <a name="page65" id="page65" ></a><span class="pagenum">65</span>about <a name="fnm86" id="fnm86"></a>Vitellius.<a href="#fn86" class="fnnum">86</a> This news had been
suppressed before Galba's murder, and it was believed that only the
army of Upper Germany had revolted. Now when they saw that the two
men in the world who were most notorious for immorality, indolence,
and extravagance had been, as it were, appointed by Providence to
ruin the empire, not only the senators and knights who had some
stake and interest in the country, but the masses as well, openly
deplored their fate. Their talk was no longer of the horrors of the
recent bloody peace: they reverted to the records of the civil wars,
the taking and retaking of Rome by her own troops, the devastation
of Italy, the pillage of the provinces, the battles of Pharsalia,
Philippi, Perusia, and <a name="fnm87" id="fnm87"></a>Mutina,<a href="#fn87" class="fnnum">87</a> those bywords of national
disaster. 'The world was turned upside down,' they mused, 'even when
good men fought for the throne: yet the Roman Empire survived the
victories of Julius Caesar and of Augustus, as the Republic would
have survived had Pompey and Brutus been victorious. But now&mdash;are we
to go and pray for Otho or for Vitellius? To pray for either would
be impious. It would be wicked to offer vows for the success of
either in a war of which we can only be sure that the winner will
prove the worse.' Some cherished hopes of Vespasian and the armies
of the <a name="page66" id="page66" ></a><span class="pagenum">66</span>East: he was preferable to either of the others; still they
shuddered at the thought of a fresh war and fresh bloodshed.
Besides, Vespasian's reputation was doubtful. He was the first
emperor who ever changed for the better.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap51" id="Ichap51"></a><span class="chapnum">51</span>I must now explain the origin and causes of the rising of
Vitellius. After the slaughter of Julius <a name="fnm88" id="fnm88"></a>Vindex<a href="#fn88" class="fnnum">88</a> and his whole
force, the troops were in high spirits at the fame and booty they
had acquired. Without toil or danger they had won a most profitable
victory. So they were all for marching against the enemy: plunder
seemed better than pay. They had endured a long and unprofitable
service, rendered the more irksome by the country and climate and by
the strict discipline observed. But discipline, however stern in
time of peace, is always relaxed in civil wars, when temptation
stands on either hand and treachery goes unpunished. Men, armour,
and horses they had in abundance for use and for show. But, whereas
before the war the soldiers only knew the men of their own company
or troop, and the provincial <a name="fnm89" id="fnm89"></a>frontier<a href="#fn89" class="fnnum">89</a> separated the armies, now,
having once joined forces against Vindex, they had gained a
knowledge of their own strength and the state of the province, and
were looking for more fighting and fresh quarrels, calling the Gauls
no longer allies, as before, but 'our enemies' or 'the vanquished'.
They had also the support of the Gallic tribes on the banks of the
Rhine, who had <a name="page67" id="page67" ></a><span class="pagenum">67</span>espoused their cause and were now the most eager to
rouse them against 'the Galbians'<a name="fnm90" id="fnm90"></a><a href="#fn90" class="fnnum">90</a> as they now called them,
despising the name of Vindex. So, cherishing hostility against the
Sequani and <a name="fnm91" id="fnm91"></a>Aedui,<a href="#fn91" class="fnnum">91</a> and against all the other communities in
proportion to their wealth, they drank in dreams of sacking towns
and pillaging fields and looting houses, inspired partly by the
peculiar failings of the strong, greed and vanity, and partly also
by a feeling of irritation at the insolence of the Gauls, who
boasted, to the chagrin of the army, that Galba had remitted a
quarter of their tribute and given the franchise and grants of land
to their <a name="fnm92" id="fnm92"></a>community.<a href="#fn92" class="fnnum">92</a> Further fuel was added by a rumour,
cunningly circulated and rashly credited, that there was a project
on foot to decimate the legions and discharge all the most
enterprising centurions. From every side came alarming news and
sinister reports from the city. The colony of <a name="fnm93" id="fnm93"></a>Lugdunum<a href="#fn93" class="fnnum">93</a> was up in
arms, and its stubborn attachment to Nero made it a hotbed of
rumour. But in the camp itself the passions and fears of the
soldiers, and, when once they had realized their strength, their
feeling of security, furnished the richest material for lies and won
them easy credence.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap52" id="Ichap52"></a><span class="chapnum">52</span>In the preceding <a name="fnm94" id="fnm94"></a>year,<a href="#fn94" class="fnnum">94</a> shortly after the beginning of
December, Aulus Vitellius had entered the province <a name="page68" id="page68" ></a><span class="pagenum">68</span>of Lower Germany
and held a careful inspection of the winter quarters of the legions.
He restored many to their rank, remitted degrading penalties, and
relieved those who had suffered disgrace, acting mainly from
ambitious motives, but partly also upon sound judgement. Amongst
other things he showed impartiality in remedying the injustices due
to the mean and dishonest way in which Fonteius Capito had issued
promotions and reductions. The soldiers did not judge Vitellius'
actions as those of a mere ex-consul: they took him for something
more, and, while serious critics found him <a name="fnm95" id="fnm95"></a>undignified,<a href="#fn95" class="fnnum">95</a> his
supporters spoke of his affability and beneficence, because he
showed neither moderation nor judgement in making presents out of
his own money and squandering other people's. Besides, they were so
greedy for power that they took even his vices for virtues. In both
armies there were plenty of quiet, law-abiding men as well as many
who were unprincipled and disorderly. But for sheer reckless
cupidity none could match two of the legionary legates, Alienus
Caecina and Fabius <a name="fnm96" id="fnm96"></a>Valens.<a href="#fn96" class="fnnum">96</a> Valens was hostile to Galba, because,
after unmasking Verginius's <a name="fnm97" id="fnm97"></a>hesitation<a href="#fn97" class="fnnum">97</a> and thwarting Capito's
designs, he considered that he had been treated with ingratitude: so
he incited <a name="page69" id="page69" ></a><span class="pagenum">69</span>Vitellius by pointing out to him the enthusiasm of the
troops. 'You,' he would say to him, 'are famous everywhere, and you
need find no obstacle in Hordeonius <a name="fnm98" id="fnm98"></a>Flaccus.<a href="#fn98" class="fnnum">98</a> Britain will join
and the German auxiliaries will flock to your standard. Galba cannot
trust the provinces; the poor old man holds the empire on
sufferance; the transfer can be soon effected, if only you will clap
on full sail and meet your good fortune half-way. Verginius was
quite right to hesitate. He came of a family of knights, and his
father was a nobody. He would have failed, had he accepted the
empire: his refusal saved him. Your father was thrice consul, and he
was censor with an emperor for his <a name="fnm99" id="fnm99"></a>colleague.<a href="#fn99" class="fnnum">99</a> That gives you
imperial dignity to start with, and makes it unsafe for you to
remain a private citizen.'</p>

<p>These promptings stirred Vitellius' sluggish nature to form desires,
but hardly hopes.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap53" id="Ichap53"></a><span class="chapnum">53</span>Caecina, on the other hand, in Upper Germany, was a
handsome youth, whose big build, imperious spirit, clever tongue,
and upright carriage had completely won the hearts of the soldiers.
While quaestor in <a name="fnm100" id="fnm100"></a>Baetica<a href="#fn100" class="fnnum">100</a> he had promptly joined Galba's party,
and in spite of his youth had been given command of a legion. Later
he was convicted of misappropriating public funds, and, on Galba's
orders, prosecuted for <a name="page70" id="page70" ></a><span class="pagenum">70</span>peculation. Highly indignant, Caecina
determined to embroil the world and bury his own disgrace in the
ruins of his country. Nor were the seeds of dissension lacking in
the army. The entire force had taken part in the war against Vindex,
nor was it until after Nero's death that they joined Galba's side,
and even then they had been forestalled in swearing allegiance by
the detachments of Lower Germany. Then again the Treviri and
<a name="fnm101" id="fnm101"></a>Lingones<a href="#fn101" class="fnnum">101</a> and the other communities which Galba had punished by
issuing harsh edicts and confiscating part of their territory, were
in close communication with the winter quarters of the legions. They
began to talk treason: the soldiers degenerated in civilian society:
it only wanted some one to avail himself of the offer they had made
to Verginius.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap54" id="Ichap54"></a><span class="chapnum">54</span>Following an ancient custom, the tribe of the Lingones had
made a present of a pair of silver <a name="fnm102" id="fnm102"></a>hands<a href="#fn102" class="fnnum">102</a> to the legions as a
symbol of hospitality. Assuming an appearance of squalid misery,
their envoys made the round of the officers' quarters and the
soldiers' tents complaining of their own wrongs and of the rewards
lavished on neighbouring tribes. Finding the soldiers ready to
listen, they made inflammatory allusions to the army itself, its
dangers and humiliation. Mutiny was almost ripe, when Hordeonius
Flaccus ordered the envoys to withdraw, and, in order to secure the
secrecy of their departure, gave instructions to them to leave the
camp <a name="page71" id="page71" ></a><span class="pagenum">71</span>by night. This gave rise to an alarming rumour. Many declared
that the envoys had been killed, and that, if they did not look out
for themselves, the leading spirits among the soldiers, who had
complained of the present state of things, would be murdered in the
dark, while their comrades knew nothing about it. So the legions
formed a secret compact. The auxiliaries were also taken into the
plot, although at first they had been distrusted, because their
infantry and cavalry had been posted in camp all round the legion's
quarters as though an attack on them were meditated. However, they
soon showed themselves the keener conspirators. Disloyalty is a
better bond for war than it ever proves in peace.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap55" id="Ichap55"></a><span class="chapnum">55</span>In Lower Germany, however, the legions on the first of
January swore the usual oath of allegiance to Galba, though with
much hesitation. Few voices were heard even in the front ranks; the
rest were silent, each waiting for his neighbour to take some bold
step. Human nature is always ready to follow where it hates to lead.
However, the feelings of the legions varied. The First and
<a name="fnm103" id="fnm103"></a>Fifth<a href="#fn103" class="fnnum">103</a> were already mutinous enough to throw a few stones at
Galba's statue. The Fifteenth and <a name="fnm104" id="fnm104"></a>Sixteenth<a href="#fn104" class="fnnum">104</a> dared not venture
beyond muttered threats, but they were watching to see the outbreak
begin. In Upper Germany, on the other hand, on the very same day,
the Fourth and the Twenty-second legions, who were quartered
together,<a name="fnm105" id="fnm105"></a><a href="#fn105" class="fnnum">105</a> smashed their <a name="page72" id="page72" ></a><span class="pagenum">72</span>statues of Galba to atoms. The Fourth
took the lead, the Twenty-second at first holding back, but
eventually making common cause with them. They did not want it to be
thought that they were shaking off their allegiance to the empire,
so in taking the oath they invoked the long obsolete names of the
Senate and People of Rome. None of the officers made any movement
for Galba, and indeed some of them, as happens in such outbreaks,
headed the rebellion. However, nobody made any kind of set speech or
mounted the platform, for there was no one as yet with whom to curry
favour.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap56" id="Ichap56"></a><span class="chapnum">56</span>The ex-consul Hordeonius Flaccus stood by and watched their
treachery. He had not the courage to check the storm or even to
rally the waverers and encourage the faithful. Sluggish and
cowardly, it was mere indolence that kept him loyal. Four centurions
of the Twenty-second legion, Nonius Receptus, Donatius Valens,
Romilius Marcellus, and Calpurnius Repentinus, who tried to protect
Galba's statues, were swept away by the rush of the soldiers and put
under arrest. No one retained any respect for their former oath of
allegiance, or even remembered it; and, as happens in mutinies, they
were all on the side of the majority.</p>

<p>On the night of the first of January a standard-bearer of the Fourth
legion came to <a name="fnm106" id="fnm106"></a>Cologne,<a href="#fn106" class="fnnum">106</a> and brought the news to Vitellius at
his dinner that the <a name="page73" id="page73" ></a><span class="pagenum">73</span>Fourth and Twenty-second legions had broken
down Galba's statues and sworn allegiance to the Senate and People
of Rome. As this oath was meaningless, it seemed best to seize the
critical moment and offer them an emperor. Vitellius dispatched
messengers to inform his own troops and generals that the army of
the Upper Province had revolted from Galba; so they must either make
war on the rebels immediately, or, if they preferred peace and
unity, make an emperor for themselves; and there was less danger, he
reminded them, in choosing an emperor than in looking for one.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap57" id="Ichap57"></a><span class="chapnum">57</span>The quarters of the First legion were nearest at hand, and
Fabius Valens was the most enterprising of the generals. On the
following day he entered Cologne with the cavalry of his legion and
auxiliaries, and saluted Vitellius as emperor. The other legions of
the province followed suit, vying with each other in enthusiasm; and
the army of the Upper Province, dropping the fine-sounding titles of
the Senate and People of Rome, joined Vitellius on the third of
January, which clearly showed that on the two previous days they
were not really at the disposal of a republican government. The
inhabitants of Cologne and the Treviri and Lingones, rivalling the
zeal of the troops, made offers of assistance, or of horses or arms
or money, each according to the measure of their strength, wealth,
<a name="page74" id="page74" ></a><span class="pagenum">74</span>or enterprise. And these offers came not only from the civil and
military authorities, men who had plenty of money to spare and much
to hope from victory, but whole companies or individual soldiers
handed over their savings, or, instead of money, their belts, or the
silver <a name="fnm107" id="fnm107"></a>ornaments<a href="#fn107" class="fnnum">107</a> on their uniforms, some carried away by a wave
of enthusiasm, some acting from motives of self-interest.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap58" id="Ichap58"></a><span class="chapnum">58</span>Vitellius accordingly commended the zeal of the troops. He
distributed among Roman knights the court-offices which had been
usually held by <a name="fnm108" id="fnm108"></a>freedmen,<a href="#fn108" class="fnnum">108</a> paid the centurions their
furlough-fees out of the imperial <a name="fnm109" id="fnm109"></a>purse,<a href="#fn109" class="fnnum">109</a> and for the most part
conceded the soldiers' savage demands for one execution after
another, though he occasionally cheated them by pretending to
imprison their victims. Thus Pompeius <a name="fnm110" id="fnm110"></a>Propinquus,<a href="#fn110" class="fnnum">110</a> the imperial
agent in Belgica, was promptly executed, while Julius Burdo, who
commanded the fleet on the Rhine, was adroitly rescued. The
indignation of the army had broken out against him, because he was
supposed to have intrigued against Fonteius Capito, and to have
accused him <a name="fnm111" id="fnm111"></a>falsely.<a href="#fn111" class="fnnum">111</a> Capito's memory was dear to the army, and
when <a name="page75" id="page75" ></a><span class="pagenum">75</span>violence reigns murder may show its face, but pardon must be
stealthy. So Burdo was kept in confinement and only released after
victory had allayed the soldiers' rancour. Meanwhile a centurion,
named Crispinus, was offered as a scape-goat. He had actually
stained his hands with Capito's blood, so his guilt seemed more
obvious to those who clamoured for his punishment, and Vitellius
felt he was a cheaper sacrifice.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap59" id="Ichap59"></a><span class="chapnum">59</span>Julius <a name="fnm112" id="fnm112"></a>Civilis<a href="#fn112" class="fnnum">112</a> was the next to be rescued from danger.
He was all-powerful among the <a name="fnm113" id="fnm113"></a>Batavi,<a href="#fn113" class="fnnum">113</a> and Vitellius did not
want to alienate so spirited a people by punishing him. Besides,
eight cohorts of Batavian troops were stationed among the Lingones.
They had been an auxiliary force attached to the Fourteenth, and in
the general disturbance had deserted the legion. Their decision for
one side or the other would be of the first importance. Nonius,
Donatius, Romilius, and Calpurnius, the centurions mentioned
above,<a name="fnm114" id="fnm114"></a><a href="#fn114" class="fnnum">114</a> were executed by order of Vitellius. They had been
convicted of loyalty, a heinous offence among deserters. His party
soon gained the accession of Valerius Asiaticus, governor of
Belgica, who subsequently married Vitellius' daughter, and of Junius
Blaesus,<a name="fnm115" id="fnm115"></a><a href="#fn115" class="fnnum">115</a> governor of the Lyons division of Gaul, who <a name="page76" id="page76" ></a><span class="pagenum">76</span>brought
with him the Italian <a name="fnm116" id="fnm116"></a>legion<a href="#fn116" class="fnnum">116</a> and a regiment of cavalry known as
'Taurus' Horse',<a name="fnm117" id="fnm117"></a><a href="#fn117" class="fnnum">117</a> which had been quartered at Lugdunum. The
forces in Raetia lost no time in joining his standard, and even the
troops in Britain showed no hesitation. <a name="Ichap60" id="Ichap60"></a><span class="chapnum">60</span>Trebellius Maximus,
the governor of Britain, had earned by his meanness and cupidity the
contempt and hatred of the <a name="fnm118" id="fnm118"></a>army,<a href="#fn118" class="fnnum">118</a> which was further inflamed by
the action of his old enemy Roscius Coelius, who commanded the
Twentieth legion, and they now seized the opportunity of the civil
war to break out into a fierce quarrel. Trebellius blamed Coelius
for the mutinous temper and insubordination of the army: Coelius
complained that Trebellius had robbed his men and impaired their
efficiency. Meanwhile their unseemly quarrel ruined the discipline
of the forces, whose insubordination soon came to a head. The
auxiliary horse and foot joined in the attacks on the governor, and
rallied round Coelius. Trebellius, thus hunted out and abandoned,
took refuge with Vitellius. The province remained quiet, despite the
removal of the ex-consul. The government was carried on by the
commanding officers of the legions, who were equal in authority,
though Coelius' audacity gave him an advantage over the rest.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap61" id="Ichap61"></a><span class="chapnum">61</span>Thus reinforced by the army from <a name="fnm119" id="fnm119"></a>Britain,<a href="#fn119" class="fnnum">119</a> Vitellius,
<a name="page77" id="page77" ></a><span class="pagenum">77</span>who now had an immense force and vast resources at his disposal,
decided on an invasion by two routes under two separate generals.
Fabius Valens was to lure the Gauls to his standard, or, if they
refused, to devastate their country, and then invade Italy by way of
the Cottian <a name="fnm120" id="fnm120"></a>Alps.<a href="#fn120" class="fnnum">120</a> Caecina was to follow the shorter route and
descend into Italy over the Pennine <a name="fnm121" id="fnm121"></a>Pass.<a href="#fn121" class="fnnum">121</a> Valens' column
comprised the Fifth legion with its 'eagle',<a name="fnm122" id="fnm122"></a><a href="#fn122" class="fnnum">122</a> and some picked
detachments from the army of Lower Germany, together with auxiliary
horse and foot, amounting in all to 40,000 men. Caecina's troops
from Upper Germany numbered 30,000, their main strength consisting
in the Twenty-first <a name="fnm123" id="fnm123"></a>legion.<a href="#fn123" class="fnnum">123</a> Both columns were reinforced by
German auxiliaries, whom Vitellius also recruited to fill up his own
army, intending to follow with the main force of the attack.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap62" id="Ichap62"></a><span class="chapnum">62</span>Strange was the contrast between Vitellius and his army.
The soldiers were all eagerness, clamouring for battle at once,
while Gaul was still frightened and Spain still undecided. Winter
was no obstacle to them; peace and delay were for cowards: they must
invade Italy and seize Rome: haste was the safest course in civil
war, where action is better than deliberation. Vitellius was dully
apathetic, anticipating <a name="page78" id="page78" ></a><span class="pagenum">78</span>his high station by indulging in idle
luxury and lavish entertainments. At midday he would be drunk and
drowsy with over-eating. However, such was the zeal of the soldiers
that they even did the general's duties, and behaved exactly as if
he had been present to encourage the alert and threaten the
laggards. They promptly fell in and began to clamour for the signal
to start. The title of Germanicus was then and there conferred on
Vitellius: Caesar he would never be called, even after his victory.</p>

<h3><a name="The_March_of_Valens_Column" id="The_March_of_Valens_Column"></a>The March of Valens' Column</h3>

<p>On the very day of departure a happy omen greeted Fabius Valens and
the army under his command. As the column advanced, an eagle flew
steadily ahead and seemed to lead the way. Loudly though the
soldiers cheered, hour after hour the bird flew undismayed, and was
taken for a sure omen of success.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap63" id="Ichap63"></a><span class="chapnum">63</span>They passed peaceably through the country of the Treviri,
who were allies. At <a name="fnm124" id="fnm124"></a>Divodurum,<a href="#fn124" class="fnnum">124</a> the chief town of the
Mediomatrici, although they were welcomed with all courtesy, the
troops fell into a sudden panic. Hastily seizing their arms, they
began to massacre the innocent citizens. Their object was not
plunder. They were seized by a mad frenzy, which was the harder to
allay as its cause was a mystery. Eventually the general's
entreaties prevailed, and they refrained from destroying the town.
However, nearly <a name="page79" id="page79" ></a><span class="pagenum">79</span>4,000 men had already been killed. This spread such
alarm throughout Gaul, that, as the army approached, whole towns
flocked out with their magistrates at their head and prayers for
mercy in their mouths. Women and boys prostrated themselves along
the roads, and they resorted to every possible means by which an
enemy's anger may be <a name="fnm125" id="fnm125"></a>appeased,<a href="#fn125" class="fnnum">125</a> petitioning for peace, though
war there was none.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap64" id="Ichap64"></a><span class="chapnum">64</span>It was in the country of the <a name="fnm126" id="fnm126"></a>Leuci<a href="#fn126" class="fnnum">126</a> that Valens heard
the news of Galba's murder and Otho's elevation. The soldiers showed
no emotion, neither joy nor fear: their thoughts were all for war.
The Gauls' doubts were now decided. They hated Otho and Vitellius
equally, but Vitellius they also feared. They next reached the
Lingones, faithful adherents of their party. There the courtesy of
the citizens was only equalled by the good behaviour of the troops.
But this did not last for long, thanks to the disorderly conduct of
the Batavian auxiliaries, who, as narrated <a name="fnm127" id="fnm127"></a>above,<a href="#fn127" class="fnnum">127</a> had detached
themselves from the Fourteenth legion and been drafted into Valens'
column. A quarrel between some Batavians and legionaries led to
blows: the other soldiers quickly took sides, and a fierce battle
would have ensued, had not Valens punished a few of the Batavians to
remind them of the discipline they seemed to have forgotten.</p><p><a name="page80" id="page80" ></a><span class="pagenum">80</span></p>

<p>Coming to the <a name="fnm128" id="fnm128"></a>Aedui,<a href="#fn128" class="fnnum">128</a> they in vain sought an excuse for
fighting. For when the natives were ordered to contribute money and
arms, they brought a gratuitous present of provisions as well.
Lugdunum did gladly what the Aedui had done from fear. But the town
was deprived of the Italian legion and Taurus' <a name="fnm129" id="fnm129"></a>Horse.<a href="#fn129" class="fnnum">129</a> Valens
decided to leave the Eighteenth <a name="fnm130" id="fnm130"></a>cohort<a href="#fn130" class="fnnum">130</a> there in its old winter
quarters as a garrison. Manlius Valens, who was in command of the
Italian legion, never received any distinction from Vitellius,
although he deserved well of the party, the reason being that Fabius
slandered him behind his back, while to avert his suspicions he
praised him to his face.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap65" id="Ichap65"></a><span class="chapnum">65</span>The recent <a name="fnm131" id="fnm131"></a>war<a href="#fn131" class="fnnum">131</a> had served to inflame the long-standing
quarrel between Lugdunum and <a name="fnm132" id="fnm132"></a>Vienne.<a href="#fn132" class="fnnum">132</a> Much damage was done on
both sides, and the frequency and animosity of their conflicts
proved that they were not merely fighting for Nero and Galba. Galba
had made his displeasure an excuse for confiscating to the Treasury
the revenues of Lugdunum, while on Vienne he had conferred various
distinctions. The result was a bitter rivalry between the towns, and
the Rhone between them only formed a bond of <a name="page81" id="page81" ></a><span class="pagenum">81</span>hatred. Consequently
the inhabitants of Lugdunum began to work on the feelings of
individual Roman soldiers, and to urge them to crush Vienne. They
reminded them how the Viennese had laid siege to Lugdunum, a Roman
colony, had assisted the efforts of Vindex, and had lately raised
troops to defend Galba. Having supplied a pretext for bad feeling,
they went on to point out the rich opportunity for plunder. Not
content with private persuasion, they presented a formal petition
that the army would march to avenge them, and destroy the
head-quarters of the Gallic war. Vienne, they urged, was thoroughly
un-Roman and hostile, while Lugdunum was a Roman <a name="fnm133" id="fnm133"></a>colony,<a href="#fn133" class="fnnum">133</a>
contributing men to the army and sharing in its victories and
reverses. They besought them in the event of adverse fortune not to
leave their city to the fury of its enemies.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap66" id="Ichap66"></a><span class="chapnum">66</span>By these arguments and others of the same nature they
brought matters to such a pass, that even the generals and party
leaders despaired of cooling the army's indignation. However, the
Viennese realized their danger. Arrayed in veils and <a name="fnm134" id="fnm134"></a>fillets,<a href="#fn134" class="fnnum">134</a>
they met the approaching column and, seizing their hands and knees
and the soles of their feet in supplication, succeeded in appeasing
the troops. Valens made each <a name="page82" id="page82" ></a><span class="pagenum">82</span>of the soldiers a present of three
hundred <a name="fnm135" id="fnm135"></a>sesterces.<a href="#fn135" class="fnnum">135</a> They were thus persuaded to respect the
antiquity and high standing of the colony, and to listen with
patience to their general's speech, in which he commended to them
the lives and property of the Viennese. However, the town was
disarmed, and private individuals had to assist the army with
various kinds of provisions. There was, however, a persistent rumour
that Valens himself had been bought with a heavy bribe. He had long
been in mean circumstances and ill concealed his sudden accession of
wealth. Prolonged poverty had whetted his inordinate desires, and
the needy youth grew into an extravagant old man.</p>

<p>He next led the army by slow stages through the country of the
Allobroges and <a name="fnm136" id="fnm136"></a>Vocontii,<a href="#fn136" class="fnnum">136</a> bribes to the general determining the
length of each day's march and the choice of a camp. For Valens
struck disgraceful bargains with the landowners and municipal
authorities, often applying violent threats, as, for instance, at
Lucus,<a name="fnm137" id="fnm137"></a><a href="#fn137" class="fnnum">137</a> a township of the Vocontii, which he threatened to burn,
until he was appeased with money. Where it was impossible to get
money, he was mollified by appeals to his lust. And so it went on
until the Alps were reached.</p>

<h3><a name="The_March_of_Caecinas_Column" id="The_March_of_Caecinas_Column"></a>The March of Caecina's Column</h3>

<p><a name="Ichap67" id="Ichap67"></a><span class="chapnum">67</span>There was even more looting and bloodshed on Caecina's
march. The Helvetii, a Gallic <a name="fnm138" id="fnm138"></a>tribe<a href="#fn138" class="fnnum">138</a> once famous as fighting men
and still distinguished by the memory of their past, having heard
nothing of Galba's murder, refused to acknowledge the authority of
Vitellius. This exasperated Caecina's headstrong nature. Hostilities
broke out owing to the greed and impatience of the Twenty-first
legion, who had seized a sum of money which was being sent to pay
the garrison of a fort in which the Helvetii used to keep native
troops at their own <a name="fnm139" id="fnm139"></a>expense.<a href="#fn139" class="fnnum">139</a> The Helvetii, highly indignant at
this, intercepted a dispatch from the German army to the Pannonian
legions, and kept a centurion and some men in custody. Greedy for
battle, Caecina hastened to take immediate vengeance without giving
them time for second thoughts. Promptly breaking up his camp, he
proceeded to harry the country, and sacked a charming and
much-frequented watering-place,<a name="fnm140" id="fnm140"></a><a href="#fn140" class="fnnum">140</a> which had grown during the long
peace into the size and importance of a town. Instructions were sent
to the Raetian auxiliaries to attack the Helvetii in the rear, while
their attention was occupied with the legion.</p><p><a name="page84" id="page84" ></a><span class="pagenum">84</span></p>

<p><a name="Ichap68" id="Ichap68"></a><span class="chapnum">68</span>Full of spirit beforehand, the Helvetii were terrified in
the face of danger. At the first alarm they had chosen Claudius
Severus general, but they knew nothing of fighting or discipline and
were incapable of combined action. An engagement with the Roman
veterans would be disastrous; and the walls, dilapidated by time,
could not stand a siege. They found themselves between Caecina and
his powerful army on the one side, and on the other the Raetian
auxiliaries, both horse and foot, and the whole fighting force of
Raetia as well, trained soldiers well used to <a name="fnm141" id="fnm141"></a>fighting.<a href="#fn141" class="fnnum">141</a> Their
country was given over to plunder and massacre. Flinging away their
arms, they wandered miserably between two fires. Wounded and
scattered, most of them took refuge on the B&ouml;tzberg.<a name="fnm142" id="fnm142"></a><a href="#fn142" class="fnnum">142</a> But some
Thracian auxiliaries were promptly sent to dislodge them. The German
army, aided by the Raetians, pursued them through the woods, and cut
them to pieces in their hiding-places. Many thousands were killed
and many sold as slaves. Having completed the work of destruction,
the army advanced in hostile array against <a name="fnm143" id="fnm143"></a>Aventicum,<a href="#fn143" class="fnnum">143</a> their
capital town, and were met by envoys offering surrender. The offer
was accepted. Caecina executed Julius Alpinus, one of their chief
men, as the prime instigator of the revolt. The rest he left to
experience the clemency or cruelty of Vitellius.</p>

<p>It is hard to say whether these envoys found Vitellius or the army
the more implacable. The soldiers <a name="page85" id="page85" ></a><span class="pagenum">85</span>clamoured for the destruction of
the <a name="fnm144" id="fnm144"></a>town,<a href="#fn144" class="fnnum">144</a> and shook their fists and weapons in the envoys'
faces: even Vitellius indulged in threatening language. Ultimately,
however, Claudius Cossus, one of the envoys, a noted speaker who
greatly enhanced the effect of his eloquence by concealing his skill
under a well-timed affectation of nervousness, succeeded in
softening the hearts of the soldiers. A mob is always liable to
sudden changes of feeling, and the men were as sensible to pity as
they had been extravagant in their brutality. Thus with streams of
tears and importunate prayers for a better answer the envoys
procured a free pardon for <a name="fnm145" id="fnm145"></a>Aventicum.<a href="#fn145" class="fnnum">145</a></p>

<p><a name="Ichap70" id="Ichap70"></a><span class="chapnum">70</span>Caecina halted for a few days in Helvetian territory until
he could get news of Vitellius' decision. Meantime, while carrying
on his preparations for crossing the Alps, he received from Italy
the joyful news that 'Silius' Horse',<a name="fnm146" id="fnm146"></a><a href="#fn146" class="fnnum">146</a> stationed at Padua, had
come over to Vitellius. The members of this troop had served under
Vitellius when pro-consul in Africa. They had subsequently been
detached under orders from Nero to precede him to Egypt, and had
then been recalled, owing to the outbreak of the war with Vindex.
They were now in Italy. Their officers, who knew nothing <a name="page86" id="page86" ></a><span class="pagenum">86</span>of Otho
and were attached to Vitellius, extolled the strength of the
approaching column and the fame of the German army. So the troop
went over to Vitellius, bringing their new emperor a gift of the
four strongest towns of the Transpadane district, Milan, Novara,
Eporedia,<a name="fnm147" id="fnm147"></a><a href="#fn147" class="fnnum">147</a> and Vercelli. Of this they informed Caecina
themselves. But one troop of horse could not garrison the whole of
the widest part of Italy. Caecina accordingly hurried forward the
Gallic, Lusitanian, and British auxiliaries, and some German
detachments, together with 'Petra's Horse',<a name="fnm148" id="fnm148"></a><a href="#fn148" class="fnnum">148</a> while he himself
hesitated whether he should not cross the Raetian <a name="fnm149" id="fnm149"></a>Alps<a href="#fn149" class="fnnum">149</a> into
Noricum and attack the governor, Petronius Urbicus, who, having
raised a force of irregulars and broken down the bridges, was
supposed to be a faithful adherent of Otho. However, he was afraid
of losing the auxiliaries whom he had sent on ahead, and at the same
time he considered that there was more glory in holding Italy, and
that, wherever the theatre of the war might be, Noricum was sure to
be among the spoils of victory. So he chose the Pennine <a name="fnm150" id="fnm150"></a>route<a href="#fn150" class="fnnum">150</a>
and led his legionaries and the heavy marching column across the
Alps, although they were still deep in <a name="fnm151" id="fnm151"></a>snow.<a href="#fn151" class="fnnum">151</a></p>

<h3><a name="Othos_Government" id="Othos_Government"></a>Otho's Government and the Distribution of Forces</h3>

<p><a name="Ichap71" id="Ichap71"></a><span class="chapnum">71</span>Meanwhile, contrary to all expectation, Otho was no prey to
idle luxury. He postponed his pleasures and disguised his
extravagance, suiting all his behaviour to the dignity of his
position. But people knew they had not seen the last of his vices,
and his virtuous hypocrisy only increased their alarm. He gave
orders to summon Marius Celsus to the Capitol. This was the
consul-elect whom he had rescued from the savage clutches of the
soldiers by pretending to put him in <a name="fnm152" id="fnm152"></a>prison.<a href="#fn152" class="fnnum">152</a> Otho now wanted to
earn a name for clemency by pardoning a well-known man, who had
fought against his party. Celsus was firm. Pleading guilty to the
charge of fidelity to Galba, he went on to show that he had set an
example which was all to Otho's advantage. Otho treated him as if
there was nothing to pardon. Calling on heaven to witness their
reconciliation, he then and there admitted him to the circle of his
intimate friends, and subsequently gave him an appointment as one of
his generals. Celsus remained faithful to Otho too, doomed
apparently to the losing side. His acquittal, which delighted the
upper classes and was popular with the mass of the people, even
earned the approval of the soldiers, who now admired the qualities
which had previously aroused their indignation.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap72" id="Ichap72"></a><span class="chapnum">72</span>Equal rejoicing, though for different reasons, <a name="page88" id="page88" ></a><span class="pagenum">88</span>followed
the long-looked-for downfall of Ofonius Tigellinus. Born of obscure
parentage, he had grown from an immoral youth into a vicious old
man. He rose to the command first of the <a name="fnm153" id="fnm153"></a>Police,<a href="#fn153" class="fnnum">153</a> and then of
the Praetorian Guards, finding that vice was a short cut to such
rewards of virtue. In these and other high offices he developed the
vices of maturity, first cruelty, then greed. He corrupted Nero and
introduced him to every kind of depravity; then ventured on some
villainies behind his back, and finally deserted and betrayed him.
Thus in his case, as in no other, those who hated Nero and those who
wished him back agreed, though from different motives, in calling
loudly for his execution. During Galba's reign he had been protected
by the influence of Titus Vinius, on the plea that he had saved his
daughter. Saved her he had, not from any feelings of pity (he had
killed too many for that), but to secure a refuge for the future.
For all such rascals, distrusting the present and fearing a change
of fortune, always prepare for themselves a shelter against public
indignation by obtaining the favour of private persons. So they rely
to escape punishment not on their innocence but on a system of
mutual insurance. People were all the more incensed against
Tigellinus, since the recent feeling against Vinius was added to
their old hatred for him. From all quarters of Rome they flocked to
the palace and the squares; and above all, in the circus and the
theatre, where the mob enjoys complete licence, they <a name="page89" id="page89" ></a><span class="pagenum">89</span>assembled in
crowds and broke out into riotous uproar. Eventually Tigellinus at
Sinuessa <a name="fnm154" id="fnm154"></a>Spa<a href="#fn154" class="fnnum">154</a> received the news that his last hour was
inevitably come. There after a cowardly delay in the foul embraces
of his prostitutes he cut his throat with a razor, and blackened the
infamy of his life by a hesitating and shameful death.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap73" id="Ichap73"></a><span class="chapnum">73</span>About the same time there arose a demand for the punishment
of Calvia Crispinilla. But she was saved by various prevarications,
and Otho's connivence cost him some discredit. This woman had
tutored Nero in vice, and afterwards crossed to Africa to incite
Clodius <a name="fnm155" id="fnm155"></a>Macer<a href="#fn155" class="fnnum">155</a> to civil war. While there she openly schemed to
start a famine in Rome. However, she secured herself by marrying an
ex-consul, and lived to enjoy a wide popularity in Rome. She escaped
harm under Galba, Otho, and Vitellius, and eventually wielded a
great influence due to her being both rich and childless,
considerations of the first importance in any state of society.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap74" id="Ichap74"></a><span class="chapnum">74</span>During this time Otho wrote constantly to Vitellius,
holding out various effeminate inducements, making him offers of
money or an influential position, or any retreat he liked to select
for a life of <a name="fnm156" id="fnm156"></a>luxury.<a href="#fn156" class="fnnum">156</a> Vitellius made similar offers. At first
both wrote in the mildest tone, though the affectation on either
side was stupid <a name="page90" id="page90" ></a><span class="pagenum">90</span>and inappropriate. But they soon struck a
quarrelsome note, and reproached each other with immorality and
crime, both with a good deal of truth. Otho recalled the commission
which Galba had sent out to <a name="fnm157" id="fnm157"></a>Germany,<a href="#fn157" class="fnnum">157</a> and, using the pretext of
senatorial authority, sent fresh commissioners to both the armies in
Germany, and also to the Italian legion, and the troops quartered at
Lugdunum. However, the commissioners remained with Vitellius with a
readiness which showed they were under no compulsion; and the guards
who had been attached to them, ostensibly as a mark of honour, were
sent back at once before they had time to mix with the legionary
soldiers. Further than this, Fabius Valens sent letters in the name
of the German army to the Guards and the City Garrison, extolling
the strength of his own side and offering to join forces. He even
went so far as to reproach them with having transferred to Otho the
title which had long <a name="fnm158" id="fnm158"></a>before<a href="#fn158" class="fnnum">158</a> been conferred on Vitellius.
<a name="Ichap75" id="Ichap75"></a><span class="chapnum">75</span>Thus they were assailed with threats as well as promises,
and told that they were not strong enough to fight, and had nothing
to lose by making peace. But, in spite of all, the fidelity of the
Guards remained unchanged. However, Otho dispatched assassins to
Germany, Vitellius to Rome. Neither met with success. Vitellius'
assassins were lost <a name="page91" id="page91" ></a><span class="pagenum">91</span>in the crowds of Rome, where nobody knows
anybody, and thus escaped detection: Otho's were betrayed by their
strange faces, since the troops all knew each other by sight.
Vitellius then composed a letter to Otho's brother <a name="fnm159" id="fnm159"></a>Titianus,<a href="#fn159" class="fnnum">159</a>
threatening that his life and his son's should answer for the safety
of Vitellius' mother and children. As it happened neither household
suffered. Fear was perhaps the reason in Otho's time, but Vitellius,
after his victory, could certainly claim credit for clemency.</p>

<p>The first news which gave Otho any degree of confidence <a name="Ichap76" id="Ichap76"></a><span class="chapnum">76</span>was
the announcement from Illyricum that the legions of Dalmatia and
Pannonia and <a name="fnm160" id="fnm160"></a>Moesia<a href="#fn160" class="fnnum">160</a> had sworn allegiance to him. Similar news
arrived from Spain, and Cluvius <a name="fnm161" id="fnm161"></a>Rufus<a href="#fn161" class="fnnum">161</a> was commended in a
special decree, but it was found out immediately afterwards that
Spain had gone over to Vitellius. Even Aquitania soon fell away,
although Julius Cordus had sworn in the province for Otho. Loyalty
and affection seemed dead: men changed from one side to the other
under the stress of fear or compulsion. It was fear which gave
Vitellius the Province of Narbonese <a name="fnm162" id="fnm162"></a>Gaul,<a href="#fn162" class="fnnum">162</a> for it is easy to go
over when the big battalions are so near. The distant provinces and
the troops across the sea all remained at Otho's disposal, but not
from any enthusiasm for <a name="page92" id="page92" ></a><span class="pagenum">92</span>his cause; what weighed with them was the
name of Rome and the title of the senate. Besides, Otho had got the
first hearing. Vespasian swore in the Jewish <a name="fnm163" id="fnm163"></a>army<a href="#fn163" class="fnnum">163</a> for Otho, and
Mucianus the legions in Syria;<a name="fnm164" id="fnm164"></a><a href="#fn164" class="fnnum">164</a> Egypt too and all the provinces
towards the East were held for him. He also received the submission
of Africa, where Carthage had taken the lead, without waiting for
the sanction of the governor, Vipstanus Apronianus. Crescens, one of
Nero's freedmen&mdash;in evil days these creatures play a part in
<a name="fnm165" id="fnm165"></a>politics<a href="#fn165" class="fnnum">165</a>&mdash;had given the common people of the town a gala dinner
in honour of the new emperor, with the result that the inhabitants
hurried into various excesses. The other African communities
followed the example of Carthage.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap77" id="Ichap77"></a><span class="chapnum">77</span>The provinces and their armies being thus divided,
Vitellius could only win the throne by fighting. Otho meanwhile was
carrying on the government as if the time were one of profound
peace. Sometimes he consulted the country's dignity, though more
often the exigencies of the moment forced him into unseemly haste.
He held the consulship himself with his brother Titianus as
colleague until the first of March. For the next two months he
appointed Verginius, as a sort of sop to the army in <a name="fnm166" id="fnm166"></a>Germany.<a href="#fn166" class="fnnum">166</a>
As colleague he gave <a name="page93" id="page93" ></a><span class="pagenum">93</span>him Pompeius Vopiscus, ostensibly because he
was an old friend of his own, but it was generally understood as a
compliment to <a name="fnm167" id="fnm167"></a>Vienne.<a href="#fn167" class="fnnum">167</a> For the rest of the year the appointments
which Nero or Galba had made were allowed to stand. The brothers
Caelius and Flavius <a name="fnm168" id="fnm168"></a>Sabinus<a href="#fn168" class="fnnum">168</a> were consuls for June and July,
Arrius <a name="fnm169" id="fnm169"></a>Antoninus<a href="#fn169" class="fnnum">169</a> and Marius Celsus for August and September;
even Vitellius after his victory did not cancel their appointment.
To the pontifical and augural colleges Otho either nominated old
ex-magistrates, as the final crown of their career, or else, when
young aristocrats returned from exile, he instated them by way of
recompense in the pontifical posts which their fathers or
grandfathers had held. He restored Cadius Rufus, Pedius Blaesus, and
<i>Saevinus Proculus</i><a name="fnm170" id="fnm170"></a><a href="#fn170" class="fnnum">170</a> to their seats in the senate. They had been
convicted during Claudius' and Nero's reigns of extortion in the
provinces. In pardoning them the name of their offence was changed,
and their greed appeared as 'treason'. For so unpopular was the law
of treason that it sapped the force of better <a name="fnm171" id="fnm171"></a>statutes.<a href="#fn171" class="fnnum">171</a></p>

<p><a name="Ichap78" id="Ichap78"></a><span class="chapnum">78</span>Otho next tried to win over the municipalities and
provincial towns by similar bribes. At the colonies <a name="page94" id="page94" ></a><span class="pagenum">94</span>of Hispalis and
<a name="fnm172" id="fnm172"></a>Emerita<a href="#fn172" class="fnnum">172</a> he enrolled new families of settlers, granted the
franchise to the whole community of the <a name="fnm173" id="fnm173"></a>Lingones,<a href="#fn173" class="fnnum">173</a> and made over
certain Moorish towns as a gift to the province of Baetica.
Cappadocia and Africa were also granted new privileges, as showy as
they were short-lived. All these grants are excused by the exigences
of the moment and the impending crisis, but he even found time to
remember his old amours and passed a measure through the senate
restoring Poppaea's <a name="fnm174" id="fnm174"></a>statues.<a href="#fn174" class="fnnum">174</a> He is believed also to have
thought of celebrating Nero's memory as a means of attracting public
sympathy. Some persons actually erected statues of Nero, and there
were times when the populace and the soldiers, by way of enhancing
his fame and dignity, saluted him as Nero Otho. However, he refused
to commit himself. He was ashamed to accept the title, yet afraid to
forbid its use.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap79" id="Ichap79"></a><span class="chapnum">79</span>While the whole of Rome was intent upon the civil war,
foreign affairs were neglected. Consequently a Sarmatian tribe
called the <a name="fnm175" id="fnm175"></a>Rhoxolani,<a href="#fn175" class="fnnum">175</a> who had cut up two cohorts of auxiliaries
in the previous winter, <a name="page95" id="page95" ></a><span class="pagenum">95</span>now formed the still more daring scheme of
invading Moesia. Inspirited by success, they assembled nearly 9,000
mounted men, all more intent on plunder than on fighting. While they
were riding about aimlessly without any suspicion of danger, they
were suddenly attacked by the Third <a name="fnm176" id="fnm176"></a>legion<a href="#fn176" class="fnnum">176</a> and its native
auxiliaries. On the Roman side everything was ready for a battle:
the Sarmatians were scattered over the country; some in their greed
for plunder were heavily laden, and their horses could scarcely move
on the slippery roads. They were caught in a trap and cut to pieces.
It is quite extraordinary how all a Sarmatian's courage is, so to
speak, outside himself. Fighting on foot, no one is more cowardly;
but their cavalry charge would break almost any troops. On this
occasion it was raining and the ground was greasy with thaw; their
pikes and their long swords, needing both hands to wield, were
useless; their horses slipped and they were encumbered by the heavy
coat of mail which all their chiefs and nobles wear. Being made of
iron plates and a very hard kind of leather, it is impenetrable to
blows, but most inconvenient for any one who is knocked down by a
charge of the enemy and tries to get up. Besides, they sank into the
deep, soft snow. The Roman soldiers in their neat leather jerkins,
armed with javelin and lance, and using, if need be, their light
swords, sprang on the unarmed Sarmatians (they never carry shields)
and stabbed them at close quarters. A few, surviving the battle, hid
<a name="page96" id="page96" ></a><span class="pagenum">96</span>themselves in the marshes, and there perished miserably from the
severity of the winter and their wounds. When the news of this
reached Rome, Marcus Aponius, the governor of Moesia, was granted a
triumphal <a name="fnm177" id="fnm177"></a>statue,<a href="#fn177" class="fnnum">177</a> while the commanding officers of the legions,
Fulvius Aurelius, Tettius Julianus, and Numisius Lupus, received the
insignia of consular rank. Otho was delighted and took all the
credit to himself, as if he had been the successful general, and had
himself employed his officers and armies to enlarge the empire.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap80" id="Ichap80"></a><span class="chapnum">80</span>In the meantime a riot broke out in an unexpected quarter,
and, though trivial at first, nearly ended in the destruction of
Rome. Otho had given orders that the Seventeenth <a name="fnm178" id="fnm178"></a>cohort<a href="#fn178" class="fnnum">178</a> should
be summoned from the colony of Ostia to the city, and Varius
Crispinus, a tribune of the guards, was instructed to provide them
with arms. Anxious to carry out his instructions undisturbed while
the camp was quiet, he arranged that the arsenal was to be opened
and the cohort's wagons loaded after nightfall. The hour aroused
suspicion; the motive was questioned; his choice of a quiet moment
resulted in an uproar. The mere sight of swords made the drunken
soldiers long to use them. They began to murmur and accuse their
officers of treachery, suggesting that the senators' slaves were
going to be armed against Otho. Some of <a name="page97" id="page97" ></a><span class="pagenum">97</span>them were too fuddled to
know what they were saying: the rascals saw a chance of plunder: the
mass of them, as usual, were simply eager for a change: and such as
were loyal could not carry out their orders in the darkness. When
Crispinus tried to check them, the mutineers killed him together
with the most determined of the centurions, seized their armour,
bared their swords, and mounting the horses, made off at full speed
for Rome and the palace.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap81" id="Ichap81"></a><span class="chapnum">81</span>It so happened that a large party of Roman senators and
their wives was dining with Otho. In their alarm they wondered
whether the soldiers' outbreak was unpremeditated or a ruse of the
emperor's: would it be safer to fly in all directions or to stay and
be arrested? At one moment they would make a show of firmness, at
the next their terror betrayed them. All the time they were watching
Otho's face, and, as happens when people suspect each other, he was
just as afraid himself as they were of him. But feeling no less
alarm for the senators than for himself, he promptly dispatched the
prefects of the Guards to appease the anger of the troops, and told
all his guests to leave immediately. Then on all sides Roman
officials could be seen to throw away their insignia, avoid their
suite, and slink off unattended. Old gentlemen and their wives
roamed the dark streets in all directions. Few went home, most of
them fled to friends, or sought an obscure refuge with the humblest
of their clients.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap82" id="Ichap82"></a><span class="chapnum">82</span>The soldiers' onrush could not be stopped at the gates of
the palace. They demanded to see Otho and <a name="page98" id="page98" ></a><span class="pagenum">98</span>invaded the banquet-hall.
Julius Martialis, a tribune of the Guards, and Vitellius Saturninus,
the camp-prefect<a name="fnm179" id="fnm179"></a><a href="#fn179" class="fnnum">179</a> of the legion, were wounded while endeavouring
to bar their progress. On every side they brandished swords and
hurled threats, now against their officers, now against the whole
senate; and since they could not select any one victim for their
wrath, in a blind frenzy of panic they clamoured for a free hand
against all the senators. At last Otho, sacrificing his dignity,
stood up on a couch and with great difficulty restrained them by
means of prayers and tears. They returned to their camp unwillingly,
and with a guilty conscience.</p>

<p>The next day Rome was like a captured city. The houses were all
shut, the streets almost deserted, and everybody looked depressed.
The soldiers, too, hung their heads, though they were more sulky
than sorry for what they had done. Their prefects, Licinius Proculus
and Plotius Firmus, harangued them by companies, the one mildly, the
other harshly, for they were men of different natures. They
concluded by announcing that the men were to receive five thousand
<a name="page99" id="page99" ></a><span class="pagenum">99</span>sesterces<a name="fnm180" id="fnm180"></a><a href="#fn180" class="fnnum">180</a> apiece. After that Otho ventured to enter the camp.
The tribunes and centurions each flinging away the insignia of his
rank,<a name="fnm181" id="fnm181"></a><a href="#fn181" class="fnnum">181</a> crowded round him begging for a safe discharge. Stung by
the disgrace of this, the troops soon quieted down, and even went
the length of demanding that the ringleaders should be punished.
<a name="Ichap83" id="Ichap83"></a><span class="chapnum">83</span>In the general disturbance Otho's position was difficult.
The soldiers were by no means unanimous. The better sort wanted him
to put a stop to the prevalent insubordination, but the great bulk
of them liked faction-fighting and emperors who had to court their
favour, and with the prospect of rioting and plunder were ready
enough for civil war. He realized, also, that one who wins a throne
by violence cannot keep it by suddenly trying to enforce the rigid
discipline of earlier days. However, the danger of the crisis both
for the city and the senate seriously alarmed him, so he finally
delivered himself as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Fellow soldiers, I have not come to fan the fire of your affection
for me, or to instil courage into your hearts: in both those
qualities you are more than rich. No, I have come to ask you to
moderate your courage and to set some bounds to your affection.
These recent disturbances did not originate in those passions of
greed or violence, which so often cause <a name="page100" id="page100" ></a><span class="pagenum">100</span>dissension in an army; nor
was it that you feared some danger and tried to shirk it. The sole
cause was your excessive loyalty, which you displayed with more
ardour than judgement. For with the best of motives, indiscretion
often lands men in disaster. We are preparing for war. Do you
imagine that we could publish all our dispatches, and discuss our
plans in the presence of the whole army, when we have to devise a
systematic campaign and keep up with the rapid changes of the
situation? There are things a soldier ought to know, but there is
much of which he must be ignorant. It is necessary for the
maintenance of strict discipline and of the general's authority that
even his tribunes and centurions should often obey blindly. If every
one is going to inquire into his motives, discipline is done for,
and his authority falls to the ground. Suppose in actual warfare you
are called to arms at dead of night: shall a few drunken
blackguards&mdash;for I cannot believe that many lost their heads in the
recent panic&mdash;go and stain their hands with their officers' blood,
and then break into the general's tent?</p>

<p><a name="Ichap84" id="Ichap84"></a><span class="chapnum">84</span>'Now I know you did it to protect me, but the riot and the
darkness and the general confusion might easily have provided an
opportunity to kill me. Suppose Vitellius and his satellites had
their choice of the state of mind they would pray to find us in;
what more could they desire than mutiny and dissension, the men
insubordinate to the centurions, and the centurions to their
superior officers, and the whole force, horse and foot alike,
rushing in headlong confusion to <a name="page101" id="page101" ></a><span class="pagenum">101</span>their ruin? Good soldiering, my
comrades, consists in obedience, not in scrutinizing the general's
orders; and the army which is most orderly in peace is most
courageous on the field of battle. Yours are the swords and the
courage; you must leave it to me to plan the campaign, and to direct
your valour. The culprits were but few, and only two are to be
punished; the rest of you must blot out all memory of that
discreditable night. No army must ever hear again such words spoken
against the senate. It is the brain of the empire and the glory of
all the provinces. Why, in Heaven's name, the very Germans
themselves, whom Vitellius is stirring up with all his might against
us, would not dare to call its members into question! Shall it be
said that Italy's own sons, the real soldiery of Rome, are
clamouring to murder and massacre the very senators whose lustre it
is that throws into the shade the obscure and vulgar adherents of
Vitellius? Vitellius has seized a few provinces and raised a sort of
shadow of an army; but the senate is on our side. Therefore, Rome is
for us; they are against her. Do you imagine that the stability of
this beautiful city consists in houses and edifices built of stone
upon stone? Nay, they are dumb inanimate things that may fall to
pieces and be rebuilt at pleasure. The eternity of our empire, the
peace of the world, your welfare and mine, all depend upon the
safety of the senate. Instituted with solemn ceremony by the father
and founder of Rome, the senate has come down in undying continuity
from the kings to the emperors; and as we have received <a name="page102" id="page102" ></a><span class="pagenum">102</span>it from our
ancestors, so let us hand it on to our posterity. From your ranks
come the senators, and from the senate come the emperors of Rome.'</p>

<p><a name="Ichap85" id="Ichap85"></a><span class="chapnum">85</span>This speech, as being well calculated to provide a
reprimand and a sedative for the soldiers, and Otho's
moderation&mdash;for he only ordered the punishment of two men&mdash;were well
received. He had calmed for a moment the troops he could not
control. Yet peace and quiet were not restored in Rome. One could
still detect the clash of arms and the lurid face of war. Refraining
from organized riot, the soldiers now dispersed to private houses
and lived in disguise, giving vent to their bad feeling by maligning
all whom nobility of birth or wealth or any other distinction made a
mark for scandal. Many, besides, believed that some of Vitellius'
soldiers had come to Rome to study the state of party feeling.
Everywhere suspicion was rife, and terror invaded even the privacy
of the home. But far greater was the alarm displayed in public
places. With every fresh piece of news that rumour brought, men's
feelings and the expression on their faces changed. They were afraid
to be found lacking in confidence when things looked doubtful, or in
joy when they went well for Otho. Above all, when the senate was
summoned to the House, they found it extraordinarily hard always to
strike the right note. Silence would argue arrogance; plain speaking
would arouse suspicion; yet flattery would be detected by Otho, who
had so lately been a private citizen, practising the art himself. So
they had to <a name="page103" id="page103" ></a><span class="pagenum">103</span>turn and twist their sentences. Vitellius they called
enemy and traitor, the more prudent confining themselves to such
vague generalities. A few ventured to fling the truth at him, but
they always chose a moment of uproar when a great many people were
all shouting at once, or else they talked so loud and fast as to
drown their own words.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap86" id="Ichap86"></a><span class="chapnum">86</span>Another cause of alarm was the various portents vouched for
by many witnesses. In the Capitoline Square, it was said, the figure
of Victory had let the reins of her chariot slip from her hands: a
ghost of superhuman size had suddenly burst out of the chapel of
Juno:<a name="fnm182" id="fnm182"></a><a href="#fn182" class="fnnum">182</a> a statue of the sainted Julius on the island in the Tiber
had, on a fine, still day, turned round from the west and faced the
east: an ox had spoken in Etruria: animals had given birth to
strange monsters. Many were the stories of these occurrences, which
in primitive ages are observed even in time of peace, though now we
only hear of them in time of panic. But the greatest damage at the
moment, and the greatest alarm for the future, was caused by a
sudden rising of the Tiber. Immensely swollen, it carried away the
bridge on <a name="fnm183" id="fnm183"></a>piles,<a href="#fn183" class="fnnum">183</a> and, its current being stemmed by the heavy
ruins, it flooded not only the flat, low-lying portions of the city,
but also districts <a name="page104" id="page104" ></a><span class="pagenum">104</span>that seemed safe from inundation. Many people
were swept away in the streets, still more were overtaken by the
flood in shops or in their beds at home. The result was a famine,
since food was <a name="fnm184" id="fnm184"></a>scarce,<a href="#fn184" class="fnnum">184</a> and the poor were deprived of their
means of livelihood. Blocks of flats, the foundations of which had
rotted in the standing water, collapsed when the river sank. No
sooner had the panic caused by the flood subsided than it was found
that, whereas Otho was preparing an expedition, its route over the
Martian Plain and up the Flaminian Road was blocked. Though probably
caused by chance, or the course of Nature, this mishap was turned
into a miraculous omen of impending disaster.</p>

acted as second-in-command (cp. ii. <a href="#IIchap89">89</a>). The post was one to which
senior centurions could rise. At this period they were not attached
to a legion, but to a camp, where more than one legion might be
quartered. That makes the phrase here used curious. The legion is
that of the marines now stationed in Rome (cp. chaps. <a href="#Ichap6">6</a> and <a href="#Ichap9">9</a>). They
appear to have joined the mutinous Seventeenth cohort when they

<h3><a name="Othos_Plans" id="Othos_Plans"></a>Otho's Plans</h3>

<p><a name="Ichap87" id="Ichap87"></a><span class="chapnum">87</span>Otho had held a purification of the <a name="fnm185" id="fnm185"></a>city<a href="#fn185" class="fnnum">185</a> and meditated
his plans for the war. Recognizing that the Pennine and Cottian Alps
and all the other passes into Gaul were held by Vitellius, he
decided to invade Narbonese Gaul by sea. His fleet was now a strong
and reliable arm, devoted to his cause. For he had formed the full
strength of a legion out of the survivors of the Mulvian Bridge
massacre,<a name="fnm186" id="fnm186"></a><a href="#fn186" class="fnnum">186</a> whom Galba's cruelty had <a name="page105" id="page105" ></a><span class="pagenum">105</span>kept in prison, and to all
the marines he had held out hopes of honourable <a name="fnm187" id="fnm187"></a>service.<a href="#fn187" class="fnnum">187</a> To the
fleet he attached the cohorts of the City Garrison and a large force
of Guards. These were the flower of the army and its chief strength,
well able to advise their own generals and to take good care of
them. The command of the expedition was entrusted to Antonius
Novellus and Suedius Clemens, both senior <a name="fnm188" id="fnm188"></a>centurions,<a href="#fn188" class="fnnum">188</a> and to
Aemilius Pacensis, to whom Otho had restored his <a name="fnm189" id="fnm189"></a>commission,<a href="#fn189" class="fnnum">189</a> of
which Galba had deprived him. In charge of the fleet he still
retained the freedman <a name="fnm190" id="fnm190"></a>Moschus<a href="#fn190" class="fnnum">190</a> to keep an eye on his betters. In
command of the cavalry and infantry he placed Suetonius Paulinus,
Marius Celsus, and Annius Gallus, but the man in whom he put most
faith was the Prefect of the Guards, Licinius Proculus. This officer
had shown himself efficient in garrison service, but was without any
experience of warfare. He maligned the characteristic virtues of his
colleagues, Paulinus' power of influence, Celsus' energy, Gallus'
ripe judgement, and being a knave and no fool, he easily got the
better of men who were both honest and loyal.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap88" id="Ichap88"></a><span class="chapnum">88</span>It was about this time that Cornelius <a name="fnm191" id="fnm191"></a>Dolabella<a href="#fn191" class="fnnum">191</a> was
banished to the colony of <a name="fnm192" id="fnm192"></a>Aquinum,<a href="#fn192" class="fnnum">192</a> though not <a name="page106" id="page106" ></a><span class="pagenum">106</span>kept in close or
dishonourable confinement. There was no charge against him: the
stigma upon him was his ancient name and <a name="fnm193" id="fnm193"></a>kinship<a href="#fn193" class="fnnum">193</a> to Galba. Otho
issued orders that several of the magistrates and a large number of
ex-consuls were to join the expedition, not to take part in the
campaign or to assist in any way, but simply as a friendly escort.
Among these was Lucius Vitellius, whom he treated neither as an
emperor's brother nor as the brother of an enemy, but just like
anybody else. Much anxiety was aroused for the safety of the city,
where all classes feared danger. The leading members of the senate
were old and infirm, and enervated by a long period of peace: the
aristocracy were inefficient and had forgotten how to fight: the
knights knew nothing of military service. The more they all tried to
conceal their alarm, the more obvious it became. Some of them, on
the other hand, went in for senseless display, and purchased
beautiful armour and fine horses: others procured as provisions of
war elaborate dinner-services or some other contrivance to stimulate
a jaded taste. Prudent men were concerned for the country's peace:
the frivolous, without a thought for the future, were inflated by
empty hopes: a good many, whose loss of credit made peace unwelcome,
were delighted at the general unrest, feeling safer among
uncertainties. <a name="Ichap89" id="Ichap89"></a><span class="chapnum">89</span>Though the cares of state were too vast to
arouse any interest in the masses, yet as the price of food rose,
and the whole revenue was devoted to military purposes, the common
<a name="page107" id="page107" ></a><span class="pagenum">107</span>people gradually began to realize the evils of war. During the
revolt of Vindex they had not suffered so much. Being carried on in
the provinces between the legionaries and the natives of Gaul it was
to all intents a foreign war, and the city had not been affected.
For from the time when the sainted Augustus organized the rule of
the Caesars the wars of the Roman people had been fought in distant
countries: all the anxiety and all the glory fell to the emperor
alone. Under Tiberius and Caligula the country only suffered from
the evils of <a name="fnm194" id="fnm194"></a>peace.<a href="#fn194" class="fnnum">194</a> Scribonianus' rising against Claudius was
no sooner heard of than <a name="fnm195" id="fnm195"></a>crushed.<a href="#fn195" class="fnnum">195</a> Nero had been dethroned more
by rumours and dispatches than by force of arms. But now not only
the legions and the fleet, but, as had seldom happened before, the
Guards and the City Garrison were called out for the campaign.
Behind them were the East and the West and all the forces of the
empire, material for a long war under any other generals. An attempt
was made to delay Otho's departure by pointing out the impiety of
his not having replaced the sacred shields in the temple of
Mars.<a name="fnm196" id="fnm196"></a><a href="#fn196" class="fnnum">196</a> But delay had ruined Nero: Otho would have none of it.
And the knowledge that Caecina <a name="page108" id="page108" ></a><span class="pagenum">108</span>had already crossed the <a name="fnm197" id="fnm197"></a>Alps<a href="#fn197" class="fnnum">197</a>
acted as a further stimulus.</p>

<p><a name="Ichap90" id="Ichap90"></a><span class="chapnum">90</span>Accordingly, on the fourteenth of March he commended the
government of the country to the senate, and granted to the restored
exiles all the rest of the property confiscated by Nero which had
not yet been sold for the imperial <a name="fnm198" id="fnm198"></a>treasury.<a href="#fn198" class="fnnum">198</a> The gift was a
just one, and made a very good impression, but as a matter of fact
it was nullified by the haste with which the work of collecting the
money had been <a name="fnm199" id="fnm199"></a>conducted.<a href="#fn199" class="fnnum">199</a> He then summoned a public meeting,
and, after extolling the majesty of Rome and praising the
wholehearted adherence of the senate and people to his cause, he
used very moderate language against the Vitellian party, criticizing
the legions more for folly than treason, and making no mention of
Vitellius himself. This may have been due to his own moderation, or
it may be that the writer of the speech felt some qualms for his own
safety, and therefore refrained from insulting Vitellius. For it was
generally believed that as in strategy he took the advice of
Suetonius Paulinus and Marius Celsus, so too in political matters he
employed the talents of Galerius <a name="fnm200" id="fnm200"></a>Trachalus.<a href="#fn200" class="fnnum">200</a> Some <a name="page109" id="page109" ></a><span class="pagenum">109</span>people even
thought they could recognize Trachalus' style of oratory, fluent and
sonorous, well adapted to tickle the ears of the crowd: and as he
was a popular pleader his style was well known. The crowd's loud
shouts of applause were in the best style of flattery, excessive and
insincere. Men vied with each other in their enthusiasm and prayers
for his success, much as though they were sending off the dictator
Caesar or the emperor Augustus. Their motive was neither fear nor
affection, but a sheer passion for servility. One can see the same
in households of slaves, where each obeys his own interest and the
common welfare counts for nothing. On his departure Otho entrusted
the peace of the city and the interests of the empire to his brother
Salvius Titianus.</p>

<h2><a name="BOOK_II" id="BOOK_II"></a>BOOK II</h2>

<h3><a name="Vespasian_and_the_East" id="Vespasian_and_the_East"></a>Vespasian and the East</h3>


<p><a name="IIchap1" id="IIchap1"></a><span class="chapnum">1</span>Meanwhile, on the other side of Europe, Fortune was already
sowing the seeds of a dynasty, the varying fortunes of which were
destined to bring at one time happiness to the country and success
to its rulers, at another misery to the country and to the rulers
destruction.<a name="fnm201" id="fnm201"></a><a href="#fn201" class="fnnum">201</a> Before Galba's fall Titus Vespasianus had been
dispatched by his father from Judaea to <a name="fnm202" id="fnm202"></a>Rome.<a href="#fn202" class="fnnum">202</a> The ostensible
reason of his journey was to show respect to the new emperor, and to
solicit some post for which his years now fitted <a name="fnm203" id="fnm203"></a>him.<a href="#fn203" class="fnnum">203</a> However,
the popular passion for invention suggested that he had been
summoned to be adopted. This rumour was based on the fact that Galba
was old and childless: the public never wearies of appointing
successors until the choice is made. The character of Titus gave
still more colour to it. He seemed capable of filling any position.
His appearance lacked neither charm nor dignity. Vespasian's
successes also and the utterances of certain oracles further
endorsed the rumour, to say nothing of the chance occurrences which
pass for omens where the wish is father to the thought. It <a name="page111" id="page111" ></a><span class="pagenum">111</span>was at
Corinth in Achaia that Titus received the news of Galba's murder,
and was assured by people in the town that Vitellius had declared
war. In great perplexity he summoned a few of his friends and
discussed all the possibilities of the situation. If he continued
his journey to Rome he would earn no gratitude for compliments
addressed to another <a name="fnm204" id="fnm204"></a>sovereign,<a href="#fn204" class="fnnum">204</a> and would be held as a hostage
either for Vitellius or for Otho: on the other hand, if he returned
to Judaea he would inevitably offend the victor. However, the
struggle was still undecided, and the father's adherence to the
successful party would excuse the conduct of the son. Or if
Vespasian himself assumed sovereignty, they would have to plan war
and forget all about giving offence.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap2" id="IIchap2"></a><span class="chapnum">2</span>Such considerations held him balanced between hope and fear;
but ultimately hope prevailed. Some people believed that his longing
to get back to Queen <a name="fnm205" id="fnm205"></a>Berenice<a href="#fn205" class="fnnum">205</a> fired him to return. True, the
young man's fancy was attracted by Berenice, but he did not allow
this to interfere with business. Still his youth was a time of gay
self-indulgence, and he showed more restraint in his own reign than
in his father's. Accordingly he sailed along the coasts of Greece
and Asia Minor, <a name="page112" id="page112" ></a><span class="pagenum">112</span>and, skirting the seas which lay upon his left,
reached the islands of Rhodes and Cyprus, whence he made a bolder
crossing to <a name="fnm206" id="fnm206"></a>Syria.<a href="#fn206" class="fnnum">206</a> On his way he conceived a desire to visit
the temple of Venus at <a name="fnm207" id="fnm207"></a>Paphos,<a href="#fn207" class="fnnum">207</a> which is famous among all the
inhabitants and visitors. It may not be tedious to give here a short
account of the origin of this worship, the ritual of the cult, and
the shape&mdash;unparalleled elsewhere&mdash;in which the goddess is depicted.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap3" id="IIchap3"></a><span class="chapnum">3</span>According to an old tradition the temple was founded by King
Aerias, and some people maintain that the goddess bears the same
name. A more modern version states that the temple was consecrated
by <a name="fnm208" id="fnm208"></a>Cinyras,<a href="#fn208" class="fnnum">208</a> on the spot where the goddess landed when the sea
gave her birth. The method of <a name="fnm209" id="fnm209"></a>divination,<a href="#fn209" class="fnnum">209</a> however, according to
this account, was imported from elsewhere by the Cilician Tamiras,
and an arrangement was made that the descendants of both families
should preside over the rites. Later, however, it seemed wrong that
the royal line should have no prerogative, so the descendants of the
<a name="fnm210" id="fnm210"></a>foreigner<a href="#fn210" class="fnnum">210</a> resigned the practice of the art which they had
themselves introduced, and now the priest whom you consult is always
of the line of Cinyras. They accept any victim that is offered, but
males are preferred. They put most faith <a name="page113" id="page113" ></a><span class="pagenum">113</span>in kids' entrails. Blood
must not be poured on the altar, at which they offer only prayers
and fire untainted by smoke. Although the altars stand in the open
air they are never wetted by rain. The goddess is not represented in
human form; the idol is a sort of circular <a name="fnm211" id="fnm211"></a>pyramid,<a href="#fn211" class="fnnum">211</a> rising from
a broad base to a small round top, like a turning-post. The reason
of this is unknown.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap4" id="IIchap4"></a><span class="chapnum">4</span>Titus inspected the temple treasures and the offerings made
by various kings, and other curiosities which the Greek passion for
archaeology attributes to a dim antiquity. He then consulted the
oracle first about his voyage. Learning that the sea was calm, and
that no obstacles stood in his way, he sacrificed a large number of
victims, and put covert questions about his own fortunes. The
priest, whose name was Sostratus, seeing that the entrails were
uniformly favourable, and that the goddess assented to Titus'
ambitious schemes, returned at the moment a brief and ordinary
reply, but afterwards sought a private interview and revealed the
future to him. So Titus returned to his father with heightened
hopes, and amid the general anxiety of the provinces and their
armies his arrival spread boundless confidence of success.</p>

<p>Vespasian had already broken the back of the Jewish <a name="fnm212" id="fnm212"></a>war.<a href="#fn212" class="fnnum">212</a> Only
the siege of Jerusalem remained. That this proved a difficult and
laborious task was due rather to the high situation of the town and
the <a name="page114" id="page114" ></a><span class="pagenum">114</span>stubborn superstition of its inhabitants than to any adequate
provision enabling them to endure the hardships of the siege.
Vespasian had, as we have already <a name="fnm213" id="fnm213"></a>stated,<a href="#fn213" class="fnnum">213</a> three legions well
tried in war. Four others were under Mucianus' command.<a href="#fn213" class="fnnum">213</a>
Although these had never seen war, yet their envy of the
neighbouring army's fame had banished sloth. Indeed, as the former
were hardened by work and danger, so the latter owed their ardour to
their unbroken inaction, and their shame at having no share in the
war.<a name="fnm214" id="fnm214"></a><a href="#fn214" class="fnnum">214</a> Both generals had, besides auxiliary infantry and cavalry,
foreign <a name="fnm215" id="fnm215"></a>fleets<a href="#fn215" class="fnnum">215</a> and allied <a name="fnm216" id="fnm216"></a>princes,<a href="#fn216" class="fnnum">216</a> and a fame that rested
on widely differing claims. <a name="IIchap5" id="IIchap5"></a><span class="chapnum">5</span>Vespasian was an indefatigable
campaigner. He headed the column, chose the camping-ground, never
ceasing by night or day to use strategy, and, if need be, the sword
to thwart the enemy. He eat what he could get, and dressed almost
like a common soldier. Indeed, save for his avarice, he matched the
generals of old days. Mucianus, on the other hand, was distinguished
by his wealth and luxury, and his general superiority to the
standards of a private person. He was the better speaker, and a
skilful administrator and statesman. Their combined qualities would
have made a fine <a name="page115" id="page115" ></a><span class="pagenum">115</span>emperor, if one could have blended their virtues
and omitted their vices. Governing as they did the neighbouring
provinces of Judaea and Syria, jealousy at first led to quarrels.
However, on the death of Nero, they forgot their dislike and joined
hands. It was their friends who first brought them together, and
subsequently Titus became the chief bond of union and for the common
good suppressed their ignoble jealousy. Both by nature and training
he had charm to fascinate even such a man as Mucianus. The tribunes
and centurions and the common soldiers were attracted, each
according to his character, either by Titus' meritorious industry or
by his gay indulgence in pleasure.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap6" id="IIchap6"></a><span class="chapnum">6</span>Before the arrival of Titus both armies had sworn allegiance
to Otho. News travels fast in such cases, but civil war is a slow
and serious undertaking, and the East, after its long repose, was
now for the first time beginning to arm for it. In earlier times all
the fiercest civil wars broke out in Italy or Cisalpine Gaul among
the forces of the West. Pompey, Cassius, Brutus, and Antony all
courted disaster by carrying the war oversea. Syria and Judaea often
heard of Caesars, but seldom saw one. There were no mutinies among
the soldiers. They merely made demonstrations against Parthia with
varying success. Even in the last civil <a name="fnm217" id="fnm217"></a>war<a href="#fn217" class="fnnum">217</a> the peace of these
provinces had been untroubled by the general confusion. Later they
were loyal to Galba. But when they heard that Otho and Vitellius
were engaged in a wicked contest for the possession <a name="page116" id="page116" ></a><span class="pagenum">116</span>of the Roman
world, the troops began to chafe at the thought that the prizes of
empire should fall to others, while their own lot was mere
compulsory submission. They began to take stock of their strength.
Syria and Judaea had seven legions on the spot with a vast force of
auxiliaries. Next came Egypt with two legions:<a name="fnm218" id="fnm218"></a><a href="#fn218" class="fnnum">218</a> beyond lay
Cappadocia and Pontus, and all the forts along the Armenian
frontier. Asia and the remaining provinces were rich and thickly
populated. As for the islands, their girdle of sea was safe from the
enemy and aided the prosecution of the war.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap7" id="IIchap7"></a><span class="chapnum">7</span>The generals were well aware of the soldiers' feelings, but
decided to await the issue between Vitellius and Otho. 'In civil
war,' they reckoned, 'there are no sure ties to unite victor and
vanquished. It matters little which survives: even good generals are
corrupted by success: as for Otho and Vitellius, their troops are
quarrelsome, lazy, and luxurious, and they are both the victims of
their own vices. One will fall on the field and the other succumb to
his success.' So Vespasian and Mucianus postponed their attack for
the present. They were themselves recent converts to the project of
war, which the <a name="fnm219" id="fnm219"></a>others<a href="#fn219" class="fnnum">219</a> had long fostered from various motives.
The better sort were animated by patriotism, many by mere love of
plunder, some by the uncertainty of their own fortunes. Thus, though
their motives differed, all, good and bad alike, agreed in their
eager desire for war.</p><p><a name="page117" id="page117" ></a><span class="pagenum">117</span></p>

<p>About this time Achaia and Asia were thrown into 8 a groundless
panic by a rumour that 'Nero was at hand'. The accounts of his death
being many and various, people were all the more inclined to allege
and to believe that he was still alive. We shall mention in the
course of this work the attempts and the fate of the other
pretenders.<a name="fnm220" id="fnm220"></a><a href="#fn220" class="fnnum">220</a> This time it was a slave from Pontus, or, according
to other traditions, a freedman from Italy. His skill as a singer
and harpist, combined with his facial resemblance to Nero, gave him
some credentials for imposture. He bribed some penniless and
vagabond deserters by dazzling promises to join him, and they all
set out to sea. A storm drove them on to the island of <a name="fnm221" id="fnm221"></a>Cythnus,<a href="#fn221" class="fnnum">221</a>
where he found some troops homeward bound on leave from the East.
Some of these he enrolled, killing all who resisted, and then
proceeded to plunder the local merchants and arm all the sturdiest
of the slaves. Finding a centurion named Sisenna carrying home a
pair of silver <a name="fnm222" id="fnm222"></a>hands<a href="#fn222" class="fnnum">222</a> as a token of alliance from the army in
Syria to the Household Guards, he tried by various devices to seduce
him, until Sisenna took fright and escaped secretly from the island
in fear of violence. Thus the panic spread. The great name of Nero
attracted many who pined for revolution and hated the existing state
of things. The rumours <a name="page118" id="page118" ></a><span class="pagenum">118</span>waxed daily, until a chance dispelled them.
<a name="IIchap9" id="IIchap9"></a><span class="chapnum">9</span>Galba had entrusted the government of Galatia and
<a name="fnm223" id="fnm223"></a>Pamphylia<a href="#fn223" class="fnnum">223</a> to Calpurnius Asprenas, who had been granted an
escort of two triremes from the fleet at Misenum. It so happened
that with these he touched at Cythnus. The rebels lost no time in
appealing to the ship's captains in the name of Nero. The pretender,
assuming an air of melancholy, appealed to 'the loyalty of his
former soldiers', and begged them to establish him in Syria or
Egypt. The captains either from sympathy or guile alleged that they
must talk to their men, and would come back when they had prepared
all their minds. However, they faithfully made a full report to
Asprenas, on whose instructions they boarded the ship and killed the
impostor, whoever he was. The man's eyes and hair and ferocious look
were so remarkable that the body was carried into Asia and thence to
Rome.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap10" id="IIchap10"></a><span class="chapnum">10</span>In a country so divided and tossed by frequent change of
rulers between liberty and licence even small events caused serious
disturbance. It happened that Vibius <a name="fnm224" id="fnm224"></a>Crispus,<a href="#fn224" class="fnnum">224</a> a man whose
wealth, influence, and ability had won him a reputation that was
great rather than good, had impeached before the senate a man of
equestrian rank, called Annius Faustus, who <a name="page119" id="page119" ></a><span class="pagenum">119</span>had been a professional
informer under Nero. The senate had recently in Galba's principate
passed a resolution authorizing the prosecution of informers. This
resolution had been variously applied from time to time, and
interpreted rigorously or leniently according as the defendant was
helpless or influential. But it still retained some terrors.
Crispus, moreover, had exerted all his powers to secure the
conviction of the man who had informed against his <a name="fnm225" id="fnm225"></a>brother.<a href="#fn225" class="fnnum">225</a> He
had, in fact, induced a large proportion of the senate to demand
that Faustus should be sent to execution undefended and unheard.
However, with others, the defendant gained a great advantage from
his prosecutor's undue influence. 'We must give him time,' they
argued, 'the charges must be published: however hateful the criminal
his case must be properly heard.' At first this advice prevailed.
The trial was postponed for a few days. At length came the
conviction of Faustus, which aroused in the country less
satisfaction than his vile character warranted. People recalled the
fact that Crispus himself had turned informer with pecuniary profit.
It was not the penalty but the prosecutor that was unpopular.</p>

<h3><a name="Othos_Measures_of_Defence" id="Othos_Measures_of_Defence"></a>Otho's Measures of Defence</h3>

<p><a name="IIchap11" id="IIchap11"></a><span class="chapnum">11</span>Meanwhile the war opened successfully for Otho. At his
order the armies of Dalmatia and Pannonia started from their base.
They comprised four <a name="fnm226" id="fnm226"></a>legions,<a href="#fn226" class="fnnum">226</a> <a name="page120" id="page120" ></a><span class="pagenum">120</span>each of which had sent forward
detachments two thousand strong. The rest followed at a short
interval: the Seventh legion raised by <a name="fnm227" id="fnm227"></a>Galba,<a href="#fn227" class="fnnum">227</a> the Eleventh and
Thirteenth, both composed of veteran troops, and the Fourteenth,
which had won great distinction by crushing the rebellion in
Britain.<a name="fnm228" id="fnm228"></a><a href="#fn228" class="fnnum">228</a> Nero had further increased their glory by choosing
them for special <a name="fnm229" id="fnm229"></a>service,<a href="#fn229" class="fnnum">229</a> which accounts for their lasting
loyalty to Nero and their keen support of Otho. But the stronger
their numbers the greater their self-confidence and the slower their
march. The cavalry and auxiliaries preceded the main body of the
legions. From Rome itself came no mean force, five regiments of
Guards with some detachments of cavalry and the First <a name="fnm230" id="fnm230"></a>legion.<a href="#fn230" class="fnnum">230</a>
To these were added an irregular force of 2,000 <a name="fnm231" id="fnm231"></a>gladiators,<a href="#fn231" class="fnnum">231</a> a
shameful assistance of which during the civil wars even strict
generals availed themselves. Annius Gallus was placed in command of
these forces with Vestricius <a name="fnm232" id="fnm232"></a>Spurinna,<a href="#fn232" class="fnnum">232</a> and they were sent
forward to hold the line of the Po. Their first plans had failed,
<a name="page121" id="page121" ></a><span class="pagenum">121</span>Caecina, whom Otho had hoped to hold within the Gallic provinces,
having already crossed the <a name="fnm233" id="fnm233"></a>Alps.<a href="#fn233" class="fnnum">233</a> Under Otho's personal command
marched picked detachments of his Body Guard and the rest of the
Household troops, together with reservists of the Guard and a large
force of <a name="fnm234" id="fnm234"></a>marines.<a href="#fn234" class="fnnum">234</a> He let no luxury either delay or disgrace his
march. In an iron breast-plate he marched on foot at the head of his
troops, looking rough and dishevelled, quite unlike his reputation.</p>

<p>Fortune smiled on his first efforts. <a name="IIchap12" id="IIchap12"></a><span class="chapnum">12</span>By sea his fleet held
most of the Italian coast right up to the foot of the Maritime Alps.
To secure these mountains and attack the province of Narbonese Gaul
he had placed in command Suedius Clemens, Antonius Novellus, and
Aemilius <a name="fnm235" id="fnm235"></a>Pacensis.<a href="#fn235" class="fnnum">235</a> Pacensis, however, was made a prisoner by
his mutinous troops: Novellus had no authority: Clemens' command
rested on popularity, and he was as greedy of battle as he was
criminally blind to insubordination. No one could have imagined they
were in Italy, on the soil of their native land. As though on
foreign shores and among an enemy's towns, they burnt, ravaged,
plundered, with results all the more horrible since no precautions
had been taken against danger. The fields were full, the houses
open. The inhabitants came to meet them with their wives and
children, and were lured by the security <a name="page122" id="page122" ></a><span class="pagenum">122</span>of peace into all the
horrors of war. The Governor of the Maritime <a name="fnm236" id="fnm236"></a>Alps<a href="#fn236" class="fnnum">236</a> at that time
was Marius Maturus. He summoned the inhabitants, whose fighting
strength was ample, and proposed to resist at the frontier the
Othonians' invasion of the province. But at the first engagement the
mountaineers were cut down and dispersed. They had assembled in
random haste; they knew nothing of military service or discipline,
nothing of the glory of victory or the disgrace of flight.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap13" id="IIchap13"></a><span class="chapnum">13</span>Enraged by this engagement, Otho's troops visited their
indignation on the town of <a name="fnm237" id="fnm237"></a>Albintimilium.<a href="#fn237" class="fnnum">237</a> The battle had
brought them no booty, for the peasants were poor and their armour
worthless, and being swift of foot, with a good knowledge of the
country, they had escaped capture. However, the soldiers sated their
greed at the expense of the innocent town. A Ligurian woman afforded
a fine example of courage which made their conduct the more odious.
She had concealed her son, and when the soldiers, who believed that
she had hidden some money as well, demanded from her under torture
where she was keeping him concealed, she pointed to her belly and
replied, 'He is in hiding.' No subsequent tortures nor even death
itself could bring her to change that brave and noble answer.</p><p><a name="page123" id="page123" ></a><span class="pagenum">123</span></p>

<p><a name="IIchap14" id="IIchap14"></a><span class="chapnum">14</span>Panic-stricken couriers brought to Fabius Valens the news
that Otho's fleet was threatening the province of Narbonese Gaul,
which had sworn allegiance to Vitellius. Representatives from the
Roman colonies also arrived beseeching his aid. He dispatched two
cohorts of the <a name="fnm238" id="fnm238"></a>Tungri<a href="#fn238" class="fnnum">238</a> and four troops of horse, together with
the entire cavalry regiment of the <a name="fnm239" id="fnm239"></a>Treviri.<a href="#fn239" class="fnnum">239</a> This force was put
under the command of Julius <a name="fnm240" id="fnm240"></a>Classicus,<a href="#fn240" class="fnnum">240</a> and part of it was
detained in the colony of Forum <a name="fnm241" id="fnm241"></a>Julii,<a href="#fn241" class="fnnum">241</a> since if the whole force
marched inland and the sea-board were left unprotected Otho's fleet
would swoop down at once. Twelve troops of cavalry and a picked body
of auxiliaries marched against the enemy: these were reinforced by a
Ligurian cohort which had long garrisoned this district, and a draft
of five hundred Pannonian recruits who had not yet joined their
legion.<a name="fnm242" id="fnm242"></a><a href="#fn242" class="fnnum">242</a> The engagement began promptly. Their line was so
arranged that some of the marines, reinforced by the peasants, held
the rising ground by the sea, while the Guards filled the level
space between the hills and the shore. The fleet, acting in
conjunction with the land force, was ready to play its part in the
battle, and extended a threatening front facing the coast. The
Vitellians, weaker in infantry, put their <a name="page124" id="page124" ></a><span class="pagenum">124</span>trust in their horse. The
<a name="fnm243" id="fnm243"></a>mountaineers<a href="#fn243" class="fnnum">243</a> were posted on the neighbouring heights, and the
auxiliaries massed in close order behind the cavalry. The Treviran
cavalry rashly charged the enemy, and meeting Otho's guards in front
were simultaneously assailed in the flank by the peasants, flinging
stones. This they could do well enough; and, drafted among the
regulars, they all, bold and timid alike, showed the same courage in
the hour of victory. Panic struck the defeated Vitellians when the
fleet began to harass their rear. They were now surrounded, and
would have been entirely destroyed had not darkness arrested the
victors and sheltered their flight. <a name="IIchap15" id="IIchap15"></a><span class="chapnum">15</span>But though beaten the
Vitellians were not cowed. Calling up reinforcements, they suddenly
attacked while the unsuspecting enemy were taking their ease after
the victory. They killed the pickets, broke into the camp and
terrified the sailors. In time the panic subsided. The Othonians
seized a hill, defended their position, and eventually assumed the
offensive. The slaughter was frightful. The officers commanding the
Tungri, after a long defence of their position, fell beneath a
shower of weapons. The victory also cost the Othonians heavy loss,
for the enemy's cavalry rallied and cut off all who rashly ventured
too far in pursuit. So they agreed to a sort of armistice. As a
safeguard against sudden raids either by the fleet on the one side
or the cavalry on the other, the Vitellians retired to
Antipolis,<a name="fnm244" id="fnm244"></a><a href="#fn244" class="fnnum">244</a> a <a name="page125" id="page125" ></a><span class="pagenum">125</span>town of the Narbonese province, and the Othonians
to <a name="fnm245" id="fnm245"></a>Albingaunum<a href="#fn245" class="fnnum">245</a> in the interior of Liguria.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap16" id="IIchap16"></a><span class="chapnum">16</span>The fame of this naval victory kept Corsica and Sardinia
and the adjacent islands faithful to Otho's cause. However, Decumus
Pacarius, the <a name="fnm246" id="fnm246"></a>procurator,<a href="#fn246" class="fnnum">246</a> nearly ruined Corsica by an act of
indiscretion, which in a war of such dimensions could not possibly
have affected the issue, and only ended in his own destruction. He
hated Otho and determined to aid Vitellius with all the forces of
Corsica; a useless assistance, even if it had been forthcoming. He
summoned the chief men of the island and disclosed his project.
Claudius Pyrrhicus, who commanded the Liburnian <a name="fnm247" id="fnm247"></a>cruisers<a href="#fn247" class="fnnum">247</a>
stationed there, and a Roman knight named <a name="page126" id="page126" ></a><span class="pagenum">126</span>Quintius Certus ventured
to oppose him. He ordered their execution. This overawed the others
who were present. So they swore allegiance to Vitellius, as did also
the general mass of ignorant people, who blindly shared a fear they
did not feel. However, when Pacarius began to enlist them and to
harass his undisciplined men with military duties, their loathing
for the unwonted labour set them thinking of their weakness. 'They
lived in an island: Vitellius' legions were in Germany, a long way
off: Otho's fleet had already sacked and plundered districts that
had even horse and foot to protect them.' The revulsion was sudden,
but did not issue in overt resistance. They chose a suitable moment
for their treachery. Waiting till Pacarius' <a name="fnm248" id="fnm248"></a>visitors<a href="#fn248" class="fnnum">248</a> were gone,
they murdered him, stripped and helpless, in his bath, and killed
his comrades too. The heads they bore themselves to Otho, like
enemies' scalps. Neither did Otho reward nor Vitellius punish them.
In the general confusion their deed was overshadowed by more heinous
crimes.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap17" id="IIchap17"></a><span class="chapnum">17</span>We have already <a name="fnm249" id="fnm249"></a>described<a href="#fn249" class="fnnum">249</a> how 'Silius' Horse' had
admitted the war into the heart of Italy. No one there either
supported Otho or preferred Vitellius. But prolonged peace had
broken their spirits to utter servility. They were an easy prey to
the first comer and cared little who was the better man. All the
fields and cities between the Alps and the Po, the most fertile
district in Italy, were held by the Vitellian forces, the cohorts
sent forward by Caecina<a href="#fn249" class="fnnum">249</a> <a name="page127" id="page127" ></a><span class="pagenum">127</span>having already arrived. One of the
Pannonian cohorts had been captured at Cremona: a hundred cavalry
and a thousand marines had been cut off between Placentia and
Ticinum.<a name="fnm250" id="fnm250"></a><a href="#fn250" class="fnnum">250</a> After this success the river and its steep banks were
no barrier to the Vitellian troops: indeed the Batavians and other
Germans found the Po a positive temptation. Crossing suddenly
opposite Placentia, they captured a handful of scouts and created
such a panic that the others in terror spread the false report that
Caecina's whole army was upon them.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap18" id="IIchap18"></a><span class="chapnum">18</span>Spurinna, who was holding Placentia, had made up his mind
that Caecina had not yet arrived, and that, if he should, his troops
must be kept within their lines: he could not pit three cohorts of
guards with one detachment a thousand <a name="fnm251" id="fnm251"></a>strong,<a href="#fn251" class="fnnum">251</a> and a few
cavalry, against Caecina's veteran army. But his men were unruly and
ignorant of <a name="fnm252" id="fnm252"></a>war.<a href="#fn252" class="fnnum">252</a> Seizing the standards and <a name="fnm253" id="fnm253"></a>colours<a href="#fn253" class="fnnum">253</a> they
broke out, threatening to kill the general who tried to check them
and paying no heed to their superior officers. They even clamoured
that Otho was being betrayed, and Caecina had been <a name="fnm254" id="fnm254"></a>summoned.<a href="#fn254" class="fnnum">254</a>
Spurinna yielded unwillingly to their folly, at first under
compulsion, later with a show of <a name="page128" id="page128" ></a><span class="pagenum">128</span>sympathy. He was anxious to gain
weight for his advice, should the mutiny cool.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap19" id="IIchap19"></a><span class="chapnum">19</span>At nightfall, with the Po in sight, Spurinna decided to
entrench his <a name="fnm255" id="fnm255"></a>camp.<a href="#fn255" class="fnnum">255</a> The unaccustomed hard work soon blunted the
enthusiasm of his town-bred troops. The older men began to curse
their credulity, and to point out the fearful danger to their small
force of being surrounded by Caecina's army in the open country.
Soon a more sober spirit pervaded the camp. The tribunes and
centurions mingled with the men, and every one talked with
admiration of Spurinna's foresight in selecting a powerful and
wealthy colony as a strong base for their operations. Finally
Spurinna himself rather explained his plans than reproached their
faults, and, leaving patrols behind, succeeded eventually in leading
the rest of the men back to Placentia in a quieter and more
submissive frame of mind. There the walls were repaired, outworks
built, and the turrets increased in height and number, while
Spurinna provided not only for arms and ammunition but also for
obedience and discipline. This was all his party lacked, for their
courage was unimpeachable.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap20" id="IIchap20"></a><span class="chapnum">20</span>Caecina, on the other hand, seemed to have left <a name="page129" id="page129" ></a><span class="pagenum">129</span>his
cruelty and profligacy on the other side of the Alps. He marched
through Italy with a well-disciplined force. The people in the
country-towns and colonies took offence at his costume as showing
arrogance. While they wore the plain toga, Caecina addressed them
attired in a parti-coloured plaid and <a name="fnm256" id="fnm256"></a>trousers.<a href="#fn256" class="fnnum">256</a> Moreover, his
wife Salonina rode on a fine horse with purple trappings, and though
this did no one any harm, they grumbled and seemed hurt. It is an
ineradicable human trait to turn critical eyes on new-found fortune,
and to insist upon moderation most of all in those who used to be
our equals. Crossing the Po, Caecina tried to undermine the loyalty
of the Othonians by negotiations and promises. They retaliated with
the same weapons, and when they had finished bandying empty and
fine-sounding phrases about Peace and Union, Caecina devoted all his
attention and plans to an assault on Placentia in terrific force. He
knew that his future reputation rested on the issue of his first
engagements.<a name="fnm257" id="fnm257"></a><a href="#fn257" class="fnnum">257</a></p>

<p><a name="IIchap21" id="IIchap21"></a><span class="chapnum">21</span>But the first day's work savoured more of impatience than
of a veteran army's methods. The men ventured under the walls
without cover or precaution, drunk and overfed. Meanwhile the
amphitheatre, a fine <a name="page130" id="page130" ></a><span class="pagenum">130</span>building outside the walls, was burnt down. It
was set on fire either by the attacking force hurling torches and
heated shot and fire-brands, or by the besieged in returning their
fire. The common people of the town harboured a suspicion that fuel
for the fire had been surreptitiously introduced from one of the
neighbouring colonies, and that the motive was jealousy, since no
building in Italy could hold so many people. However it happened,
they thought little of it, while worse disasters threatened: safety
assured, they bewailed it as the worst calamity they could have
suffered. To return, however, to Caecina: he was repulsed with heavy
losses, and the night was spent in preparations. The Vitellians
provided mantlets, fascines, and <a name="fnm258" id="fnm258"></a>penthouses,<a href="#fn258" class="fnnum">258</a> to protect the
assailants while undermining the walls: the Othonians procured
stakes and huge masses of stone or lead or brass, to break through
the enemy's formation and crush them to pieces. Both parties were
actuated by feelings of pride and ambition. Various encouragements
were used, one side praising the strength of the legions and the
German army, the other the reputation of the Guards and the City
Garrison. The Vitellians decried their enemy as lazy effeminates
demoralized by the circus and the theatre: to which they replied
that the Vitellians were a pack of foreigners and barbarians.
<a name="page131" id="page131" ></a><span class="pagenum">131</span>Meanwhile, Otho and Vitellius were held up to praise or blame,
insult providing the more fruitful stimulus.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap22" id="IIchap22"></a><span class="chapnum">22</span>Hardly had day dawned before the walls of Placentia
bristled with defenders, and the fields glittered with the soldiers'
armour. The Vitellian <a name="fnm259" id="fnm259"></a>legions<a href="#fn259" class="fnnum">259</a> advancing in close order with
their auxiliaries in scattered bands assailed the higher portions of
the walls with stones and arrows: where the walls were in disrepair
or crumbling from age they came close up to them. The Othonians
above, poising and aiming their weapons with surer effect, rained
them down on the Germans, who came rashly charging under the walls
with the wild songs and scanty dress of their country, brandishing
their shields over their heads. Meanwhile, the legionaries under
cover of their mantlets and fascines set to work to undermine the
walls, build up a mound, and assail the gates, while Otho's Guards
rolled on to them with terrific crashes huge millstones, which they
had arranged for this purpose along the walls. Of those beneath,
some were crushed by the stones; others, wounded by darts, were left
mangled and bleeding to death. Panic redoubled the slaughter, and
the rain of missiles came all the fiercer from the walls. At last
they sacrificed the honour of their party and beat a retreat.
Caecina, ashamed of his rash attempt at assault, was afraid of
looking ridiculous and useless if he sat still in the same camp. So
he crossed the Po <a name="page132" id="page132" ></a><span class="pagenum">132</span>and made for Cremona. As he was retiring,
Turullius Cerialis with a large force of marines, and Julius
<a name="fnm260" id="fnm260"></a>Briganticus<a href="#fn260" class="fnnum">260</a> with a few cavalry, came over to his side. The
latter, a Batavian born, had held a cavalry command: the former was
a senior centurion, who was known to Caecina, as he had served in
that capacity in Germany.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap23" id="IIchap23"></a><span class="chapnum">23</span>Spurinna, learning the enemy's route, informed Annius
<a name="fnm261" id="fnm261"></a>Gallus<a href="#fn261" class="fnnum">261</a> by letter of all that had happened, the defence of
Placentia and Caecina's plans. Gallus was leading the First legion
to the relief of Placentia, for he doubted the ability of the weak
force of Guards to resist a long siege and the full strength of the
German army. Hearing that Caecina was defeated and making for
Cremona, he halted at Bedriacum, though he found it hard to restrain
the ardour of his troops, whose zeal for battle nearly broke into
mutiny. The village of Bedriacum lies between Verona and
Cremona,<a name="fnm262" id="fnm262"></a><a href="#fn262" class="fnnum">262</a> and two Roman disasters have now given it a sinister
notoriety.</p>

<p>In the same week Martius <a name="fnm263" id="fnm263"></a>Macer<a href="#fn263" class="fnnum">263</a> gained a victory in the
neighbourhood of Cremona. With great enterprise he had transported
his gladiators across the Po, and suddenly flung them on to the
opposite bank. There <a name="page133" id="page133" ></a><span class="pagenum">133</span>they routed the Vitellian auxiliaries and
killed all who offered resistance, the rest taking flight to
Cremona. But Macer checked their victorious ardour, for fear that
the enemy might be reinforced and reverse the fortune of the battle.
This aroused suspicion among the Othonians, who put a bad
construction on all that their generals did. All the least
courageous and most impudent of the troops vied incessantly with
each other in bringing various charges against Annius Gallus,
Suetonius Paulinus, and Marius Celsus, for the two latter had also
been placed in command by <a name="fnm264" id="fnm264"></a>Otho.<a href="#fn264" class="fnnum">264</a> The most energetic in promoting
mutiny and dissension were Galba's murderers, who, maddened by their
feelings of fear and of guilt, created endless disorder, sometimes
talking open sedition, sometimes sending anonymous letters to Otho.
As he always believed men of the meaner sort and distrusted
patriots, he now wavered nervously, being always irresolute in
success and firmer in the face of danger. He therefore sent for his
brother <a name="fnm265" id="fnm265"></a>Titianus<a href="#fn265" class="fnnum">265</a> and gave him the chief command.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap24" id="IIchap24"></a><span class="chapnum">24</span>Meanwhile success attended the generalship of Paulinus and
Celsus.<a name="fnm266" id="fnm266"></a><a href="#fn266" class="fnnum">266</a> Caecina was tortured by his constant failure and the
waning reputation of his <a name="page134" id="page134" ></a><span class="pagenum">134</span>army. Repulsed from Placentia, he had
lately seen his auxiliaries defeated, and his patrols constantly
worsted in skirmishes more frequent than memorable. Now that Fabius
Valens was close at hand, he determined not to let all the glory of
the war fall to him, and hastened with more zeal than prudence to
retrieve his reputation. About twelve <a name="fnm267" id="fnm267"></a>miles<a href="#fn267" class="fnnum">267</a> distant from
Cremona, at a place called <i>Twin Brethren</i>,<a name="fnm268" id="fnm268"></a><a href="#fn268" class="fnnum">268</a> he carefully
concealed the bravest of his auxiliaries in a wood overlooking the
road. The cavalry were ordered to ride forward down the road and
provoke an engagement. They were then to feign flight and lure the
pursuers on in hot haste until they fell into the ambush. This plan
was betrayed to Otho's generals. Paulinus took charge of the
infantry, Celsus of the horse. A detachment of the Thirteenth
legion,<a name="fnm269" id="fnm269"></a><a href="#fn269" class="fnnum">269</a> four auxiliary cohorts of foot, and five hundred
cavalry were stationed on the left flank. Three cohorts of the
Guards in column occupied the raised high-road.<a name="fnm270" id="fnm270"></a><a href="#fn270" class="fnnum">270</a> On the right
flank marched the First legion, two auxiliary cohorts of foot, and
five hundred cavalry. Besides these they moved out a thousand
cavalry&mdash;Guards and auxiliaries&mdash;as a reserve to crown their
success, or assist them in difficulties.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap25" id="IIchap25"></a><span class="chapnum">25</span>Before they came to close quarters, the Vitellians began to
retire. Celsus, forewarned of the ruse, <a name="page135" id="page135" ></a><span class="pagenum">135</span>halted his men. Whereupon
the Vitellians impatiently rose from their ambush and, while Celsus
slowly retired, followed him further and further until they plunged
headlong into an ambush themselves. The auxiliaries were on their
flanks; the legions faced them in front; and the cavalry by a sudden
man&oelig;uvre had closed in on their rear. However, Suetonius Paulinus
did not immediately give the signal for his infantry to charge. He
was by nature dilatory, and preferred cautiously reasoned measures
to accidental success. He kept on issuing orders about filling up
the ditches, clearing the fields and extending the line, convinced
that it was soon enough to play for victory when he had taken every
precaution against defeat. This delay gave the Vitellians time to
take refuge in the vineyards, where the interlaced vine-stems made
it hard to follow. Adjoining these was a little wood, from under
cover of which they ventured another sally and killed the foremost
of the Guards' cavalry. There Prince <a name="fnm271" id="fnm271"></a>Epiphanes<a href="#fn271" class="fnnum">271</a> was wounded,
while making vigorous efforts to rally Otho's forces.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap26" id="IIchap26"></a><span class="chapnum">26</span>At this point Otho's infantry charged, crushed the opposing
line, and even routed the troops who were hurrying up in support.
For Caecina had brought up his reinforcements not all at once but in
separate detachments. These, arriving in scattered units, and never
in sufficient force, only added to the confusion, since the panic of
the rout infected them as well. <a name="page136" id="page136" ></a><span class="pagenum">136</span>Mutiny, too, broke out in the camp,
because the troops were not all taken into battle. Julius Gratus,
the camp-prefect, was put in irons on a charge of plotting with his
brother, who was fighting on Otho's side. It was known that the
Othonians had arrested the brother, Julius Fronto, on the same
charge. For the rest, such was the universal panic among pursuers
and pursued, on the field and in the camp, that it was commonly said
on both sides that, if Suetonius Paulinus had not sounded the
retreat, Caecina's whole army might have been destroyed. Paulinus
maintained that he avoided any excessive strain of work or marching,
for fear of exposing his exhausted troops to a counter-attack from
the Vitellians in the camp, who were still fresh for battle:
besides, he had no reserves to fall back on in case of defeat. A few
approved of the general's strategy, but the common opinion was
adverse.<a name="fnm272" id="fnm272"></a><a href="#fn272" class="fnnum">272</a></p>

Vespasian once more transferred it to imperial government. If
<i>procurator</i> is correct here, Pacarius must have been a subordinate
imperial functionary in a senatorial province. As the province
changed hands so often and was so soon after this placed under
imperial control, it is possible that Tacitus made a mistake and
that Pacarius was an ex-praetor. Those who feel that Tacitus is
unlikely to have made this error, and that Pacarius can hardly have
been anything but governor, adopt the suggestion that Corsica did
not share the fate of Sardinia in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 67, but remained
under the control of an imperial procurator. There is no clear

<h3><a name="The_Decisive_Struggle" id="The_Decisive_Struggle"></a>The Decisive Struggle</h3>

<p><a name="IIchap27" id="IIchap27"></a><span class="chapnum">27</span>This reverse reduced the Vitellians not to despair but to
discipline. Not only was this the case in Caecina's camp, who blamed
his men as being readier for mutiny than for battle, but the troops
under Fabius Valens, who had now reached <a name="fnm273" id="fnm273"></a>Ticinum,<a href="#fn273" class="fnnum">273</a> lost their
contempt for the enemy, conceived a desire to <a name="page137" id="page137" ></a><span class="pagenum">137</span>retrieve their glory,
and offered their general a more respectful and steady obedience.
There had, indeed, been a serious outbreak of mutiny, the account of
which I may now resume from an earlier <a name="fnm274" id="fnm274"></a>chapter,<a href="#fn274" class="fnnum">274</a> where it seemed
wrong to break the narrative of Caecina's operations. The Batavian
auxiliaries, who had left the Fourteenth legion during the war
against Vindex, heard of Vitellius' rising while on their way to
Britain, and, as I have already <a name="fnm275" id="fnm275"></a>described,<a href="#fn275" class="fnnum">275</a> joined Fabius Valens
in the country of the Lingones. There they grew insolent. Whenever
they passed the tents of the Roman soldiers, they boasted loudly
that they had coerced the Fourteenth, had deprived Nero of Italy,
and held the whole issue of the war in the hollow of their hand.
This insulted the soldiers and annoyed the general; brawls and
quarrels ruined good discipline. Ultimately Valens began to suspect
that their insubordination meant treachery. <a name="IIchap28" id="IIchap28"></a><span class="chapnum">28</span>Accordingly, on
receiving the news that Otho's fleet had defeated the Treviran
<a name="fnm276" id="fnm276"></a>cavalry<a href="#fn276" class="fnnum">276</a> and the Tungri, and was now blockading Narbonese Gaul,
he determined at the same time to assist his allies, and by a stroke
of generalship to separate contingents that were so insubordinate
and, if united, so strong. He therefore ordered the Batavians to
march to the support of Narbo. Immediately this order became
generally known, the auxiliaries began to complain and the
legionaries to chafe. 'They were being deprived of their strongest
support: here were these invincible veterans promptly withdrawn
<a name="page138" id="page138" ></a><span class="pagenum">138</span>directly the enemy came in sight: if the province was more
important than the safety of Rome and the empire, why not all go
there? but if Italy was the corner-stone of their success, he ought
not as it were to amputate their strongest limb.'<a name="fnm277" id="fnm277"></a><a href="#fn277" class="fnnum">277</a> <a name="IIchap29" id="IIchap29"></a><span class="chapnum">29</span>In
answer to this presumptuous criticism, Valens loosed his lictors
upon them and set to work to check the mutiny. They attacked their
general, stoned him, and chased him out of the camp, shouting that
he was concealing the spoils of Gaul and the gold from <a name="fnm278" id="fnm278"></a>Vienne,<a href="#fn278" class="fnnum">278</a>
the due reward of their labours. They looted the baggage, ransacked
the general's quarters, and even rummaged in the ground with
javelins and lances. Valens, in slave's dress, took refuge with a
cavalry officer. Gradually the disorder began to die down. Alfenus
Varus, the camp-prefect, then hit upon the plan of forbidding the
centurions to go the rounds or to have the bugle sounded to summon
the men to their duties. No one had anything to do: they eyed each
other in astonishment, dismayed above all at having no one to
command them. At first by silent submission, at last with tearful
prayers, they sought pardon. Valens appeared, haggard and in tears,
but above all expectation safe and sound,&mdash;joy, sympathy, cheers!
With a wild revulsion of feeling&mdash;mobs are always extravagant&mdash;they
made a ring round him with the eagles and standards, and carried him
to the Tribunal with loud praises and congratulations. With wise
moderation he demanded <a name="page139" id="page139" ></a><span class="pagenum">139</span>no punishment, but, to disarm suspicion of
his good faith, he criticized one or two of them <a name="fnm279" id="fnm279"></a>severely.<a href="#fn279" class="fnnum">279</a> He
was well aware that in civil war the men are allowed more licence
than their officers.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap30" id="IIchap30"></a><span class="chapnum">30</span>While they were entrenching themselves at Ticinum they
heard the news of Caecina's defeat, and the mutiny nearly broke out
afresh: Valens, they thought, had treacherously delayed in order to
keep them out of the battle. They refused rest, would not wait for
the general, marched on in front of the standards, hurrying on the
bearers, and by a forced march joined Caecina. Valens had a bad name
with Caecina's army. They complained that despite their greatly
inferior numbers he had exposed them to the full force of the enemy.
At the same time, for fear of being despised as defeated cowards,
they excused themselves by exaggerating the strength of the new
arrivals. In fact, though Valens' numbers were larger, and he had
almost twice as many legionaries and auxiliaries as <a name="fnm280" id="fnm280"></a>Caecina,<a href="#fn280" class="fnnum">280</a>
yet it was Caecina who enjoyed the confidence of the men. Apart from
his kindness, in which he seemed much readier than Valens, they
admired him for his youthful vigour and commanding <a name="fnm281" id="fnm281"></a>stature,<a href="#fn281" class="fnnum">281</a> and
liked him too without exactly knowing why. So there was rivalry
between the generals. Caecina mocked at Valens for <a name="page140" id="page140" ></a><span class="pagenum">140</span>his dirty and
dishonest ways:<a name="fnm282" id="fnm282"></a><a href="#fn282" class="fnnum">282</a> Valens at Caecina's pompous vanity. But they
smothered their dislike and worked together for a common end,
writing frequent letters in which they sacrificed all hope of pardon
and heaped abuse on Otho. Otho's generals refrained from retaliating
upon Vitellius, though his character offered richer scope.
<a name="IIchap31" id="IIchap31"></a><span class="chapnum">31</span>In death Otho earned a noble name and Vitellius infamy, yet
at this time people were more afraid of Otho's burning passions than
of Vitellius' listless luxury. The murder of Galba had made Otho
feared and hated, while no one attributed to Vitellius the outbreak
of the war. It was felt that Vitellius' gluttony was a personal
disgrace: Otho's excesses, his cruelty and his daring, spelt more
danger to the country.</p>

<p>Now that Caecina and Valens had joined forces, the Vitellians had no
longer any reason to avoid a decisive battle. Otho accordingly held
a council to decide whether they should prolong the war or put their
fortune to the test. <a name="IIchap32" id="IIchap32"></a><span class="chapnum">32</span>Suetonius Paulinus, who was considered
the most experienced general of his <a name="fnm283" id="fnm283"></a>day,<a href="#fn283" class="fnnum">283</a> now felt it was due to
his reputation to deliver his views on the general conduct of the
war. His contention was that the enemy's interests were best served
by haste, Otho's by delay. He argued thus: 'The whole of Vitellius'
force has now arrived and he has <a name="page141" id="page141" ></a><span class="pagenum">141</span>few reinforcements in his rear,
for the Gallic provinces are in a ferment, and it would be fatal to
abandon the Rhine with all those hostile tribes ready to swarm
across it. The troops in Britain are busy with their own foes and
cut off by the sea: the Spanish provinces can scarcely spare any
troops: the Narbonese are seriously alarmed by their recent reverse
and the inroads of our fleet. The country across the Po is shut in
by the Alps and denied all supplies by <a name="fnm284" id="fnm284"></a>sea,<a href="#fn284" class="fnnum">284</a> and, besides, its
resources have been already exhausted by the passage of their army.
Nowhere can they get supplies, and without commissariat no army can
be kept together. The German troops are their strongest fighting
arm, but their constitutions will not be strong enough to stand the
change of weather, if we protract the war into the summer. It has
often happened that a force, which seemed irresistible at first, has
dwindled to nothing through the tedium of forced inaction.</p>

<p>'On the other hand, our resources are rich and reliable. We have on
our side Pannonia, Moesia, Dalmatia, and the East; the armies there
are fresh and strong; we have Italy and Rome, the Queen of the
World, and the Roman Senate and People: those titles always mean
something, though their glory may sometimes be obscured. We have
large public and private resources, and in civil war a vast quantity
of money is stronger than the sword. Our soldiers are inured to the
Italian climate or, at any rate, to heat. We are <a name="page142" id="page142" ></a><span class="pagenum">142</span>entrenched behind
the Po:<a name="fnm285" id="fnm285"></a><a href="#fn285" class="fnnum">285</a> its cities are protected by strong walls and willing
hands, and the defence of Placentia has shown that none of them will
yield to the enemy.' Therefore Otho must remain on the defensive. In
a few days the Fourteenth legion would arrive: its fame alone was
great, and the Moesian <a name="fnm286" id="fnm286"></a>forces<a href="#fn286" class="fnnum">286</a> would be with it. He should, at
any rate, postpone his deliberations until then, and fight, if fight
he must, with augmented strength.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap33" id="IIchap33"></a><span class="chapnum">33</span>Marius Celsus supported Paulinus. Annius Gallus had been
hurt a few days before by a fall from his horse, but messengers were
sent to inquire his views, and they reported that he too agreed.
Otho inclined to a decisive engagement. His brother Titianus and
Proculus, the prefect of the Guard, with all the impatience of
inexperience, stoutly maintained that fortune and Providence, and
Otho's own good genius inspired his policy, and would inspire its
performance. They had descended to flattery by way of checking
opposition. When it was decided to take the offensive, the question
arose whether Otho in person should take part in the battle or hold
himself in reserve. His evil counsellors again carried their point.
Otho was to retire to <a name="fnm287" id="fnm287"></a>Brixellum,<a href="#fn287" class="fnnum">287</a> and, by withdrawing from the
<a name="page143" id="page143" ></a><span class="pagenum">143</span>hazards of the field, reserve himself for the supreme control of
the campaign and of the empire. To this Paulinus and Celsus offered
no further opposition, for fear of seeming to endanger the person of
their prince. From this day dates the decline of Otho's party. Not
only did he take with him a considerable force of the Guards, Body
Guard, and cavalry, but the spirit of the troops who remained behind
was broken. The men trusted no one but Otho, and Otho no one but the
men. His generals were under suspicion and their authority left in
doubt.<a name="fnm288" id="fnm288"></a><a href="#fn288" class="fnnum">288</a></p>

<p><a name="IIchap34" id="IIchap34"></a><span class="chapnum">34</span>None of these arrangements failed to reach the ears of the
Vitellians. Desertions were frequent, as they always are in civil
war, and the scouts in their eagerness to discover the enemy's plans
always failed to conceal their own. Caecina and Valens, counting on
the fatal impatience of the enemy, remained quietly on their guard
to see what they would do: for it is always wisdom to profit by
another's folly. Feigning an intention of crossing the Po, they
began to construct a bridge, partly as a demonstration against the
<a name="fnm289" id="fnm289"></a>gladiators<a href="#fn289" class="fnnum">289</a> on the opposite bank, partly to find something for
their idle troops to do. Boats were placed at equal intervals with
their heads up stream and fastened together by strong wooden planks.
They also cast anchors from them to ensure the solidity of the
<a name="page144" id="page144" ></a><span class="pagenum">144</span>bridge, but they allowed the hawsers to drift slack, so that when
the river rose the boats might all rise with it without the line
being broken. To guard the bridge a high tower was built out on the
end boat, from which they could repulse the enemy with various
artillery. Meanwhile the Othonians had built a tower on the bank and
kept up a steady shower of stones and torches.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap35" id="IIchap35"></a><span class="chapnum">35</span>In midstream there was an island, to which the gladiators
tried to make their way in boats, but the Germans swam over and got
there first. When a good number of them had swam across, Macer
manned some Liburnian <a name="fnm290" id="fnm290"></a>cruisers<a href="#fn290" class="fnnum">290</a> and attacked them with the
bravest of his gladiators. But they fought with less courage than
soldiers, and from their unsteady boats they could not shoot so well
as the others, who had a firm footing on the bank. Swaying this way
and that in their alarm, the sailors and the marines were beginning
to get in each other's way, when the Germans actually leapt into the
shallows, caught hold of the boats by the stern, and either
clambered up by the gangways or sunk them bodily with their own
hands. All this took place before the eyes of both <a name="fnm291" id="fnm291"></a>armies<a href="#fn291" class="fnnum">291</a>, and
the higher rose the spirits of the Vitellians, the greater became
the indignation of the Othonians against Macer, the author and cause
of their disaster. <a name="IIchap36" id="IIchap36"></a><span class="chapnum">36</span>The <a name="page145" id="page145" ></a><span class="pagenum">145</span>remainder of the boats were
eventually dragged <a name="fnm292" id="fnm292"></a>off,<a href="#fn292" class="fnnum">292</a> and the battle ended in flight. The
army demanded Macer's execution. He had been actually wounded by a
lance that had been flung at him, and the soldiers were rushing on
him with drawn swords when some tribunes and centurions intervened
and rescued him.</p>

<p>Soon after this, Vestricius Spurinna, on Otho's orders, brought up a
reinforcement of the Guards, leaving behind a small garrison at
Placentia, and before long, Otho sent the consul-elect, Flavius
Sabinus,<a name="fnm293" id="fnm293"></a><a href="#fn293" class="fnnum">293</a> to take command of Macer's force. This change pleased
the soldiers, but the frequent mutinies made the generals unwilling
to assume such a perilous command.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap37" id="IIchap37"></a><span class="chapnum">37</span>In some of my <a name="fnm294" id="fnm294"></a>authorities<a href="#fn294" class="fnnum">294</a> I find a statement that
either a growing fear of war or dislike of the two emperors, whose
discreditable misconduct grew daily more notorious, led the armies
to hesitate whether they should not give up the struggle and either
themselves combine to choose an emperor or refer the choice to the
senate. This, it is suggested, was the motive of Otho's generals in
advising delay, and Paulinus in particular had high hopes, since he
was the senior ex-consul, and a distinguished general who <a name="page146" id="page146" ></a><span class="pagenum">146</span>had
earned a brilliant reputation by his operations in Britain. For my
own part, while I am ready to admit that a few people may have
tacitly wished for peace instead of civil war, or for a good and
virtuous emperor instead of two who were the worst of criminals, yet
I imagine that Paulinus was much too wise to hope that in a time of
universal corruption the people would show such moderation. Those
who had sacrificed peace in a passion for war were not likely to
stop the war from any affection for peace. Nor was it possible that
armies whose language and characteristics differed so widely should
ever come to such an agreement. As for the officers; nearly all of
them were extravagant, bankrupt, and guilty of some crime: they had
not a good enough conscience to put up with any emperor who was not
as vicious as themselves and under an obligation for their services.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap38" id="IIchap38"></a><span class="chapnum">38</span>The old ingrained human passion for power matured and burst
into prominence with the growth of the empire. With straiter
resources equality was easily preserved. But when once we had
brought the world to our feet and exterminated every rival state or
king, we were left free to covet power without fear of interruption.
It was then that strife first broke out between patricians and
plebeians: at one time arose seditious <a name="fnm295" id="fnm295"></a>tribunes,<a href="#fn295" class="fnnum">295</a> at another
tyrannous consuls:<a name="fnm296" id="fnm296"></a><a href="#fn296" class="fnnum">296</a> <a name="page147" id="page147" ></a><span class="pagenum">147</span>in the Forum at Rome were sown the first
seeds of civil war. Before long, Marius, rising from the lowest
ranks of the people, and Sulla, the most cruel of all the nobles,
crushed our liberty by force of arms and substituted a despotism.
Then came Pompey, whose aims, though less patent, were no better
than theirs. From that time onwards the one end sought was supreme
power in the state. Even at Pharsalia and Philippi the citizen
armies did not lay down their arms. How then can we suppose that the
troops of Otho and Vitellius would have willingly stopped the war?
The same anger of heaven, the same human passions, the same criminal
motives drove them into discord. True these wars were each settled
by a single battle, but that was due to the generals' cowardice.
However, my reflections on the ancient and the modern character have
carried me too far: I must now resume the thread of our narrative.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap39" id="IIchap39"></a><span class="chapnum">39</span>When Otho started for Brixellum, he left his brother
Titianus in nominal command, though the real power lay with the
prefect Proculus. As for Celsus and Paulinus, no use was made of
their experience, and their empty titles were used as a screen for
other people's blunders. The tribunes and centurions felt themselves
in an ambiguous position, seeing the better generals sacrificed and
the worst in command. The men were full of spirit, but preferred
criticizing to carrying out their officers' orders. It was decided
to advance and encamp four miles west of Bedriacum. <a name="page148" id="page148" ></a><span class="pagenum">148</span>Though it was
spring, and rivers abounded, the men were very foolishly allowed to
suffer from want of water. Here a council of war was held, for Otho
kept sending dispatches urging haste, and the soldiers kept
clamouring for their emperor to lead them. Many demanded that the
troops stationed across the <a name="fnm297" id="fnm297"></a>Po<a href="#fn297" class="fnnum">297</a> should be brought up. It is not
so easy to decide what was the best thing they could have done as to
be sure that what they did do was the worst. <a name="IIchap40" id="IIchap40"></a><span class="chapnum">40</span>They were in
marching order, not fighting trim, and their objective was the
confluence of the Po and the <a name="fnm298" id="fnm298"></a>Arda,<a href="#fn298" class="fnnum">298</a> sixteen miles away. Celsus
and Paulinus refused to expose their troops, fatigued by the march
and under heavy kit, to the assault of an enemy who, while still
fresh after covering barely four miles, would certainly attack them,
either while they were in the disorder of a marching column, or when
they had broken up to dig trenches. However, Titianus and Proculus,
worsted in argument, appealed to their authority: and there arrived
post-haste a Numidian orderly with a peremptory dispatch from Otho,
criticizing his generals' inaction, and ordering them to bring
matters to a head. He was sick of delay and too impatient to live on
hope.</p><p><a name="page149" id="page149" ></a><span class="pagenum">149</span></p>

<p><a name="IIchap41" id="IIchap41"></a><span class="chapnum">41</span>On that same day, while Caecina was busy with the
bridge-building <a name="fnm299" id="fnm299"></a>operations,<a href="#fn299" class="fnnum">299</a> two officers of the Guards came and
demanded an interview. He was preparing to hear and answer their
proposals, when some scouts burst in with the news that the enemy
were close at hand. The officers' conversation was thus interrupted,
and it was left uncertain whether they were broaching a hostile plot
or a piece of treachery, or some honest plan. Caecina, dismissing
the officers, rode back to the camp, where he found that Valens had
given orders to sound for battle, and the troops were already under
arms. While the legions were balloting for the order in which they
were to take the field, the cavalry rode out and charged. Strange to
say, they would have been hurtled back upon the trenches by a
smaller force of Othonians, had not the Italian legion bravely
<a name="page150" id="page150" ></a><span class="pagenum">150</span>stopped them by drawing their swords and forcing them to go back
and resume the fight. The Vitellian legions formed without any
disorder, for though the enemy were close at hand, thick plantations
hid the approaching force. In the Othonian army the generals were
nervous and the men ill-disposed towards them: their march was
hindered by carts and camp-followers, and the high <a name="fnm300" id="fnm300"></a>road,<a href="#fn300" class="fnnum">300</a> with
its deep ditches on either side, was too narrow even for a peaceful
march. Some of the men formed round their standards, others went
searching for their place: on every side there was an uproar as men
ran about shouting to each other: the boldest kept pressing on to
the front, while the tide of the timid ebbed to the rear.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap42" id="IIchap42"></a><span class="chapnum">42</span>Amid the confusion of this sudden panic somebody invented a
story that Vitellius' army had abandoned his cause, whereupon an
unwarrantable glee relaxed their efforts. It was never fully known
whether this report was spread by Vitellian scouts or whether it was
started on Otho's side, either by treachery or chance. Losing all
their thirst for battle the Othonians actually broke into a cheer.
The enemy answered with angry shouts, and most of Otho's soldiers,
having no idea what caused the cheering, feared treachery. At this
point the Vitellian line charged. They were fresh, and in good
order, stronger and more numerous. However, the Othonians, despite
their disorder, fewer numbers, and fatigue, offered a stubborn
resistance. The ground was encumbered with orchards and vineyards,
<a name="page151" id="page151" ></a><span class="pagenum">151</span>and the character of the battle varied accordingly. They fought now
from a distance, now at close quarters, and charged sometimes in
detachment, sometimes in <a name="fnm301" id="fnm301"></a>column.<a href="#fn301" class="fnnum">301</a> On the raised high-road they
fought hand to hand, using the weight of their bodies and their
shields. They gave up throwing their javelins and cut through helmet
and breastplate with sword and axe. Each man knew his foe; they were
in view of the other troops;<a name="fnm302" id="fnm302"></a><a href="#fn302" class="fnnum">302</a> and they fought as if the whole
issue of the war depended on them.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap43" id="IIchap43"></a><span class="chapnum">43</span>It happened that two legions met in the open fields between
the high road and the Po. These were: for Vitellius the
Twenty-first, commonly called <a name="fnm303" id="fnm303"></a>Rapax,<a href="#fn303" class="fnnum">303</a> a regiment of old renown;
and for Otho the First <a name="fnm304" id="fnm304"></a>Adiutrix,<a href="#fn304" class="fnnum">304</a> which had never been in battle
before, but was full of spirit and eager to win its first laurels.
Their charge overthrew the front ranks of the Twenty-first, and they
carried off its eagle. Fired with indignation, the Twenty-first
rallied and charged the front of the enemy, killing the commanding
officer, Orfidius Benignus, and capturing many of their colours.</p>

<p>On the other flank the <a name="fnm305" id="fnm305"></a>Fifth<a href="#fn305" class="fnnum">305</a> drove the <a name="fnm306" id="fnm306"></a>Thirteenth<a href="#fn306" class="fnnum">306</a> <a name="page152" id="page152" ></a><span class="pagenum">152</span>off the
field. The <a name="fnm307" id="fnm307"></a>Fourteenth<a href="#fn307" class="fnnum">307</a> were surrounded by the numbers that
attacked them. Otho's generals had long ago fled. Caecina and Valens
began to bring up the reserves to the support of their men, and, as
a fresh reinforcement, there arrived Varus <a name="fnm308" id="fnm308"></a>Alfenus<a href="#fn308" class="fnnum">308</a> with his
Batavians. They had routed the <a name="fnm309" id="fnm309"></a>gladiators<a href="#fn309" class="fnnum">309</a> by confronting them
and cutting them to pieces in the river before their transports
could land, and flushed by their victory came charging in upon the
flank of the enemy.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap44" id="IIchap44"></a><span class="chapnum">44</span>Their centre broken, the Othonians fled in disorder, making
for Bedriacum. The distance was immense;<a name="fnm310" id="fnm310"></a><a href="#fn310" class="fnnum">310</a> the road encumbered
with heaps of dead. This made the slaughter all the greater, for in
civil war captives cannot be turned to <a name="fnm311" id="fnm311"></a>profit.<a href="#fn311" class="fnnum">311</a> Suetonius
Paulinus and Licinius Proculus avoided the camp at Bedriacum by
diverse routes. Vedius Aquila, who commanded the Thirteenth legion,
was so paralysed by fear that he allowed himself to fall into the
hands of the indignant troops. It was still broad daylight when he
entered <a name="page153" id="page153" ></a><span class="pagenum">153</span>the camp. Immediately a crowd of mutinous fugitives came
clamouring round him. They spared neither abuse nor violence,
assailing him as a deserter and a traitor. They could bring no
special charge against him, but the mob always lay their own
disgrace on some one else. Night came to the aid of Titianus and
Celsus, for Annius <a name="fnm312" id="fnm312"></a>Gallus<a href="#fn312" class="fnnum">312</a> had already placed sentinels on guard
and got the men under control. Using remonstrances, prayers, and
commands, he had induced them not to add to the disaster of their
defeat by murdering their own friends. Whether the war was over, or
whether they wanted to fight again, in defeat, he told them, union
was the one thing that could help them. All the other <a name="fnm313" id="fnm313"></a>troops<a href="#fn313" class="fnnum">313</a>
were crushed by the blow. The Guards complained that they had been
beaten, not by the enemy's valour, but by sheer treachery. 'Why,'
they said, 'even the Vitellians have won no bloodless victory. We
beat their cavalry and captured a standard from one of their
legions. We still have Otho left and all the troops with him on the
other side of the Po. The Moesian <a name="fnm314" id="fnm314"></a>legions<a href="#fn314" class="fnnum">314</a> are on their way.
There is a large force left at Bedriacum. These, at any rate, have
not been defeated yet. Better fall, if need be, on the field.' Now
exasperated, now depressed by these reflections, they were in a
state of blank despair, which more often aroused their anger than
their fear.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap45" id="IIchap45"></a><span class="chapnum">45</span>The Vitellian army halted at the fifth mile-stone on <a name="page154" id="page154" ></a><span class="pagenum">154</span>the
road from Bedriacum. Their generals would not venture to storm the
camp that same day, and hoped the enemy would consent to surrender.
However, although they were in fighting trim, and had no implements
for digging trenches, they felt safe with their arms and the pride
of victory. On the next day there was no doubt about the wishes of
the Othonians. Even those who showed most spirit had now changed
their minds. So they sent a deputation. The Vitellian generals had
no hesitation in granting terms. However, they detained the
deputation for a short time, which caused some qualms to those who
did not know whether it had been successful. At length the envoys
returned, and the gates of the camp were opened. Then both victors
and vanquished burst into tears, and with a sort of sorrowful
satisfaction cursed their fate of civil war. There in one tent were
men of both armies, nursing a wounded brother or some other
relative. Their hopes of recompense were doubtful: all that was
certain was bereavement and grief, for no one was so fortunate as to
mourn no loss. They searched for the body of the fallen officer,
Orfidius, and burnt it with due solemnity. Of the other dead, some
were buried by their relatives, the rest were left lying on the
ground.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap46" id="IIchap46"></a><span class="chapnum">46</span>Otho<a name="fnm315" id="fnm315"></a><a href="#fn315" class="fnnum">315</a> was awaiting news of the battle with perfect
confidence and firm resolve. First came a disquieting rumour. Soon
fugitives from the field revealed the ruin of his cause. But the
soldiers in their zeal did <a name="page155" id="page155" ></a><span class="pagenum">155</span>not wait to hear their emperor speak.
'Keep a good heart,' they said, 'you still have fresh forces left,
and, as for us, we are ready to risk everything and suffer
everything.' Nor was this flattery. In a wild passion of enthusiasm
they urged him to march to the field and restore the fortunes of his
party. Those who were near him clasped his knees, while those who
stood further off stretched out their arms to <a name="fnm316" id="fnm316"></a>him.<a href="#fn316" class="fnnum">316</a> The most
eager of all was Plotius Firmus, the Prefect of the Guard, who
besought Otho again and again not to desert a supremely faithful
army, men who had done him such great service. He told him that it
showed more courage to bear misfortune than to give in: that men of
vigour and courage cling to their hopes even in the face of
disaster: it is only cowards who let their terror hurry them into
despair. Amid all these appeals the soldiers now cheered, now
groaned, according as Otho's expression showed signs of yielding or
seemed to harden. Nor were these feelings confined to Otho's own
Guards. The first arrivals from Moesia assured him that the spirit
of the advancing force was just as firm, and that they had already
entered <a name="fnm317" id="fnm317"></a>Aquileia.<a href="#fn317" class="fnnum">317</a> There is no room for doubt that it was still
possible to revive this cruel and pitiable war, so full of
uncertainty to both <a name="fnm318" id="fnm318"></a>parties.<a href="#fn318" class="fnnum">318</a></p><p><a name="page156" id="page156" ></a><span class="pagenum">156</span></p>

<p><a name="IIchap47" id="IIchap47"></a><span class="chapnum">47</span>Otho himself disliked the policy of fighting. 'Am I,' he
said, 'to expose all your splendid courage and devotion to further
risks? That would be too great a price to pay for my life. Your high
hopes of succeeding, if I were minded to live, will only swell the
glory of my death. We have learnt to know each other, Fortune and I.
Do not reckon the length of my reign. Self-control is all the harder
when a man knows that his fortune cannot last. It was Vitellius who
began the civil war. He originated the policy of fighting for the
throne. But one battle is enough. This is the precedent that I will
set. Let posterity judge me by it. I do not grudge Vitellius his
brother, or wife, or children. I want neither revenge nor
consolation. Others may have held the sceptre longer, but no one can
ever have laid it down so bravely. Am I the man to allow the flower
of Rome in all these famous armies to be mown down once again and
lost to the country? Let me take with me the consciousness that you
would have died for me. But you must stay and live. No more delay. I
must no longer interfere with your chance of pardon, nor you with my
resolve. It is a sort of cowardice to go on talking about the end.
Here is your best proof of my determination: I complain of no one.
To blame gods or men is his alone who fain would keep his life.'</p><p><a name="page157" id="page157" ></a><span class="pagenum">157</span></p>

<p><a name="IIchap48" id="IIchap48"></a><span class="chapnum">48</span>After some such speech as this he urged them courteously to
hurry away and not to exasperate the victor by their hesitation. To
each man's age and position he paid due regard, using his authority
with the young and persuasion with his elders, while his quiet looks
and firm speech helped to control their ill-timed tears. He gave
orders for boats and carriages to be provided for their departure.
All petitions and letters containing any compliments to himself, or
marked insults to Vitellius, he destroyed, and distributed his money
carefully, not like a man at the point of death. He then actually
tried to comfort the sorrowful fears of his nephew, Salvius
Cocceianus,<a name="fnm319" id="fnm319"></a><a href="#fn319" class="fnnum">319</a> by praising his attachment and chiding his alarm.
'Do you imagine,' he said, 'that Vitellius will be so hard-hearted
as not to show me some gratitude for saving his whole household? By
promptly putting an end to myself, I deserve to earn some mercy for
my family. For it is not in blank despair, but with my army
clamouring for battle, that I determine to save my country from the
last calamities. I have won enough fame for myself and ennoblement
for my posterity; for, after the line of the Julians, Claudians,
Servians,<a name="fnm320" id="fnm320"></a><a href="#fn320" class="fnnum">320</a> I have been the first to bring the principate into a
new family. So rouse yourself and go on with your life. Never forget
that Otho was your uncle, yet keep your remembrance within bounds.'</p>
<p><a name="page158" id="page158" ></a><span class="pagenum">158</span></p>

<p><a name="IIchap49" id="IIchap49"></a><span class="chapnum">49</span>After this he made them all retire and rested for a while.
But his last reflections were interrupted by a sudden disturbance
and the news of a mutinous outbreak among the troops. They were
threatening to kill all those who were leaving, and turned with
especial violence against <a name="fnm321" id="fnm321"></a>Verginius,<a href="#fn321" class="fnnum">321</a> whose house was in a state
of siege. Otho rebuked the ringleaders and returned, consenting to
receive the adieux of those who were going, until it was time for
them to depart in safety. As the day deepened into evening he
quenched his thirst with a drink of iced water. Two daggers were
brought to him and, after trying them both, he put one under his
pillow. Being assured on inquiry that his friends had started, he
spent a peaceful night, not, it is said, without sleep. At break of
<a name="fnm322" id="fnm322"></a>day<a href="#fn322" class="fnnum">322</a> he fell upon his dagger. Hearing his dying groan, his
slaves and freedmen entered with Plotius Firmus, the Prefect of the
Guards, and found a single wound in his breast. The funeral was
hurried forward out of respect for his own earnest entreaties, for
he had been afraid his head might be cut off and subjected to
outrage. The Guard carried the body, sounding his praises with tears
in their eyes, and covering his hands and wounded breast with
kisses. Some of the soldiers killed themselves beside the pyre, not
because they had harmed Vitellius or feared reprisals, but from love
of their emperor, and to follow his noble example. Similar suicides
became common afterwards at Bedriacum <a name="page159" id="page159" ></a><span class="pagenum">159</span>and Placentia, and in other
encampments.<a name="fnm323" id="fnm323"></a><a href="#fn323" class="fnnum">323</a> An inconspicuous tomb was built for Otho, as being
less likely to be disturbed: and thus he ended his life in his
thirty-seventh year.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap50" id="IIchap50"></a><span class="chapnum">50</span>Otho came originally from the borough of <a name="fnm324" id="fnm324"></a>Ferentium.<a href="#fn324" class="fnnum">324</a>
His father had been consul and his grandfather praetor. His mother's
family was inferior, but not without <a name="fnm325" id="fnm325"></a>distinction.<a href="#fn325" class="fnnum">325</a> His boyhood
and youth were such as we have seen. By his two great <a name="fnm326" id="fnm326"></a>acts,<a href="#fn326" class="fnnum">326</a> one
most criminal and the other heroic, he earned in equal measure the
praise and the reprobation of posterity. It would certainly be
beneath the dignity of my task to collect fabulous rumours for the
amusement of my readers, but there are certain popular traditions
which I cannot venture to contradict. On the day of the battle of
Bedriacum, according to the account of the local peasants, a strange
bird appeared in a much-frequented grove near Regium <a name="fnm327" id="fnm327"></a>Lepidum.<a href="#fn327" class="fnnum">327</a>
There it sat, unterrified and unmoved, either by the crowds of
people or by the birds which fluttered round it, until the moment at
which Otho killed himself. Then it vanished. A calculation of the
time showed that the prodigy's appearance and disappearance
coincided with the beginning of the <a name="fnm328" id="fnm328"></a>battle<a href="#fn328" class="fnnum">328</a> and Otho's death.</p><p><a name="page160" id="page160" ></a><span class="pagenum">160</span></p>

<p><a name="IIchap51" id="IIchap51"></a><span class="chapnum">51</span>At his funeral the rage and grief of the soldiers broke out
into another mutiny. This time there was no one to control them.
They turned to Verginius and begged him with threats now to accept
the principate, now to head a deputation to Caecina and Valens.
However, Verginius escaped them, slipping out by the back door of
his house just as they broke in at the front. Rubrius Gallus carried
a petition from the Guards at Brixellum, and obtained immediate
pardon. Simultaneously Flavius Sabinus surrendered to the victor the
troops under his <a name="fnm329" id="fnm329"></a>command.<a href="#fn329" class="fnnum">329</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="fn298" id="fn298"></a><span class="label"><a href="#fnm298">298</a> </span>About seven miles below Cremona. The Medicean MS. has
Adua, but as the mouth of the Adua is seven miles west of Cremona
and Bedriacum twenty-two miles east of Cremona, the figures given do
not suit. For Tacitus says that they marched first four miles and
then sixteen. Mr. Henderson proposes to solve the difficulty by
reading <i>quartum decimum</i> for <i>quartum</i> in chap. <a href="#IIchap39">39</a>. But his reasons
are purely <i>a priori</i>. If the confluence was that of the <i>Arda</i> with
the Po, Tacitus' <i>quartum</i> is still unsatisfactory, but the
distances given in Plutarch's Life of Otho would suit the facts. He
makes the first march a little over six miles. From the camp then
pitched to the mouth of the Arda would be by road about sixteen
miles. Thus Tacitus' first figure may be a slight underestimate and
his second figure correct. The second day's march, according to
Plutarch, was rather more than twelve miles, so we may suppose that
the armies met about four miles short of the confluence, which was
the Othonians' objective. This suits Paulinus' suggestion a few
lines lower that the Vitellians need only march four miles to catch
them in marching column. The whole question is fully discussed by
Mr. Henderson (op. cit.) and by Mr. E.G. Hardy in the <i>Journal of
Philology</i>, vol. xxxi, no. 61.</p></div>

<h3><a name="Vitellius_Principate" id="Vitellius_Principate"></a>Vitellius' Principate</h3>

<p><a name="IIchap52" id="IIchap52"></a><span class="chapnum">52</span>Now that the war was everywhere ended, a large number of
senators, who had quitted Rome with Otho and been left behind at
Mutina,<a name="fnm330" id="fnm330"></a><a href="#fn330" class="fnnum">330</a> found themselves in a critical position. When the news
of the defeat reached Mutina, the soldiers paid no heed to what they
took for a baseless rumour, and, believing the senators to be
hostile to Otho, they treasured up their conversation and put the
worst interpretation on their looks and behaviour. In time they
broke into abusive reproaches, seeking a pretext for starting a
general massacre, while the senators suffered at the same time from
another source of alarm, for they were afraid of seeming to be slow
in welcoming the victory of the now predominant Vitellian party.
Terrified at their double danger, they held a meeting. For no one
<a name="page161" id="page161" ></a><span class="pagenum">161</span>dared to form any policy for himself; each felt safer in sharing
his guilt with others. The town-council of Mutina, too, kept adding
to their anxiety by offering them arms and money, styling them with
ill-timed respect 'Conscript Fathers'. <a name="IIchap53" id="IIchap53"></a><span class="chapnum">53</span>A remarkable quarrel
arose at this meeting. Licinius Caecina attacked Eprius
<a name="fnm331" id="fnm331"></a>Marcellus<a href="#fn331" class="fnnum">331</a> for the ambiguity of his language. Not that the
others disclosed their sentiments, but Caecina, who was still a
nobody, recently raised to the senate, sought to distinguish himself
by quarrelling with some one of importance, and selected Marcellus,
because the memory of his career as an informer made him an object
of loathing. They were parted by the prudent intervention of their
betters, and all then retired to <a name="fnm332" id="fnm332"></a>Bononia,<a href="#fn332" class="fnnum">332</a> intending to continue
the discussion there, and hoping for more news in the meantime. At
Bononia they dispatched men along the roads in every direction to
question all new-comers. From one of Otho's freedmen they inquired
why he had come away, and were told he was carrying his master's
last instructions: the man said that when he had left, Otho was
still indeed alive, but had renounced the pleasures of life and was
devoting all his thoughts to posterity. This filled them with
admiration. They felt ashamed to ask any more questions&mdash;and
declared unanimously for Vitellius.</p><p><a name="page162" id="page162" ></a><span class="pagenum">162</span></p>

<p><a name="IIchap54" id="IIchap54"></a><span class="chapnum">54</span>Vitellius' brother Lucius was present at their discussion,
and now displayed his willingness to receive their flattery, but one
of Nero's freedmen, called Coenus, suddenly startled them all by
inventing the atrocious falsehood that the Fourteenth legion had
joined forces with the troops at Brixellum, and that their sudden
arrival had turned the fortune of the day: the victorious army had
been cut to pieces. He hoped by inventing this good news to regain
some authority for Otho's <a name="fnm333" id="fnm333"></a>passports,<a href="#fn333" class="fnnum">333</a> which were beginning to be
disregarded. He did, indeed, thus insure for himself a quick journey
to Rome, but was executed by order of Vitellius a few days later.
However, the senate's danger was augmented because the soldiers
believed the news. Their fears were the more acute, because it
looked as if their departure from Mutina was an official move of the
Council of State, which thus seemed to have deserted the party. So
they refrained from holding any more meetings, and each shifted for
himself, until a letter arrived from Fabius Valens which quieted
their fears. Besides, the news of Otho's death travelled all the
more quickly because it excited admiration.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap55" id="IIchap55"></a><span class="chapnum">55</span>At Rome, however, there was no sign of panic. The festival
of <a name="fnm334" id="fnm334"></a>Ceres<a href="#fn334" class="fnnum">334</a> was celebrated by the usual crowds. When it was
reported in the theatre on reliable authority that Otho had
renounced his <a name="fnm335" id="fnm335"></a>claim,<a href="#fn335" class="fnnum">335</a> and <a name="page163" id="page163" ></a><span class="pagenum">163</span>that Flavius <a name="fnm336" id="fnm336"></a>Sabinus,<a href="#fn336" class="fnnum">336</a> the City
Prefect, had made all the troops in Rome swear allegiance to
Vitellius, the audience cheered Vitellius. The populace decked all
the busts of Galba with laurel-leaves and flowers, and carried them
round from temple to temple. The garlands were eventually piled up
into a sort of tomb near Lake <a name="fnm337" id="fnm337"></a>Curtius,<a href="#fn337" class="fnnum">337</a> on the spot which Galba
had stained with his life-blood. In the senate the distinctions
devised during the long reigns of other emperors were all conferred
on Vitellius at <a name="fnm338" id="fnm338"></a>once.<a href="#fn338" class="fnnum">338</a> To these was added a vote of thanks and
congratulation to the German army, and a deputation was dispatched
to express the senate's satisfaction. Letters were read which Fabius
Valens had addressed to the consuls in very moderate terms. But
Caecina's moderation was still more gratifying: he had not written
at <a name="fnm339" id="fnm339"></a>all.<a href="#fn339" class="fnnum">339</a></p>

<p><a name="IIchap56" id="IIchap56"></a><span class="chapnum">56</span>However, Italy found peace a more ghastly burden than the
war. Vitellius' soldiers scattered through all the boroughs and
colonial towns, indulging in plunder, violence, and rape. Impelled
by their greed or the promise of payment, they cared nothing for
right and wrong: kept their hands off nothing sacred or profane.
Even civilians put on uniform and seized the opportunity to murder
their enemies. The soldiers themselves, <a name="page164" id="page164" ></a><span class="pagenum">164</span>knowing the countryside
well, marked down the richest fields and wealthiest houses for
plunder, determined to murder any one who offered resistance. Their
generals were too much in their debt to venture any opposition. Of
the two Caecina showed less greed and more ambition. Valens had
earned a bad name by his own ill-gotten gains, and was therefore
bound to shut his eyes to others' <a name="fnm340" id="fnm340"></a>shortcomings.<a href="#fn340" class="fnnum">340</a> The resources
of Italy had long been exhausted; all these thousands of infantry
and cavalry, all this violence and damage and outrage was almost
more than the country could bear.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap57" id="IIchap57"></a><span class="chapnum">57</span>Meanwhile Vitellius knew nothing of his victory. With the
remainder of his German army he continued to advance as though the
war had just begun. A few of the veterans were left in winter
quarters, and troops were hurriedly enlisted in the Gallic
provinces, to fill up the vacancies in what were now mere skeleton
legions.<a name="fnm341" id="fnm341"></a><a href="#fn341" class="fnnum">341</a> Leaving Hordeonius Flaccus to guard the line of the
Rhine, Vitellius advanced with a picked detachment from the army in
Britain, eight thousand strong. After a few days' march he received
news of the victory of Bedriacum and the collapse of the war on the
death of Otho. He summoned a meeting and heaped praise on the
courage of the troops. When the <a name="page165" id="page165" ></a><span class="pagenum">165</span>army demanded that he should confer
equestrian rank on his freedman Asiaticus, he checked their shameful
flattery. Then with characteristic instability he granted at a
private banquet what he had refused in public. This Asiaticus, who
was thus decorated with the gold ring, was an infamous menial who
rose by his <a name="fnm342" id="fnm342"></a>vices.<a href="#fn342" class="fnnum">342</a></p>

<p><a name="IIchap58" id="IIchap58"></a><span class="chapnum">58</span>During these same days news arrived that Albinus, the
Governor of Mauretania, had been murdered, and both <a name="fnm343" id="fnm343"></a>provinces<a href="#fn343" class="fnnum">343</a>
had declared for Vitellius. Appointed by Nero to the province of
Mauretania Caesariensis, Lucceius Albinus had further received from
Galba the governorship of Tingitana, and thus commanded a very
considerable force, consisting of nineteen cohorts of infantry, five
regiments of horse, and an immense horde of Moors, well trained for
war by their practice in plunder. After Galba's murder he inclined
to Otho's side and, not contented with the province of Africa, began
to threaten Spain on the other side of the narrow strait. Cluvius
Rufus,<a name="fnm344" id="fnm344"></a><a href="#fn344" class="fnnum">344</a> alarmed at this, moved the Tenth <a name="fnm345" id="fnm345"></a>legion<a href="#fn345" class="fnnum">345</a> down to the
coast as though for transport. He also sent some centurions ahead to
gain the sympathies of the Moors for Vitellius. The great reputation
of the German army throughout the provinces facilitated this task,
and they also spread a <a name="page166" id="page166" ></a><span class="pagenum">166</span>rumour that Albinus was not contented with
the title of 'Governor', and wanted to adopt a regal style under the
name of Juba. So the sympathies of the army shifted.
<a name="IIchap59" id="IIchap59"></a><span class="chapnum">59</span>Asinius Pollio, who commanded the local cavalry, one of
Albinus' most loyal friends, was assassinated. The same fate befell
Festus and Scipio, who were in command of the <a name="fnm346" id="fnm346"></a>infantry.<a href="#fn346" class="fnnum">346</a> Albinus
himself embarked from Tingitana for Caesariensis, and was murdered
as he landed. His wife confronted the assassins and was murdered
too. How all this happened Vitellius never inquired. He passed by
events of the highest importance after a few moments' attention,
being quite unable to cope with serious matters.</p>

<p>On reaching the <a name="fnm347" id="fnm347"></a>Arar,<a href="#fn347" class="fnnum">347</a> Vitellius ordered his army to march
overland while he sailed down the river. Travelling with no imperial
state, he had nothing but his original <a name="fnm348" id="fnm348"></a>poverty<a href="#fn348" class="fnnum">348</a> to make him
conspicuous, until Junius Blaesus, Governor of the Lyons division of
Gaul, a member of an eminent family, whose liberality matched his
wealth, provided the emperor <a name="page167" id="page167" ></a><span class="pagenum">167</span>with a staff and escorted him in
person with great courtesy, an attention which proved most unwelcome
to Vitellius, although he concealed his annoyance under the grossest
flattery. At Lugdunum he found the generals of both parties awaiting
him. Valens and Caecina were openly commended at a public meeting,
and given places on either side of the emperor's throne. He then
sent the whole army to fetch his infant <a name="fnm349" id="fnm349"></a>son,<a href="#fn349" class="fnnum">349</a> and when they
brought him wearing a general's uniform, Vitellius took him up in
his arms and named him <a name="fnm350" id="fnm350"></a>Germanicus,<a href="#fn350" class="fnnum">350</a> at the same time decorating
him with all the insignia of his imperial position. The exaggerated
honours of these days proved the child's only consolation for the
evil times which <a name="fnm351" id="fnm351"></a>followed.<a href="#fn351" class="fnnum">351</a></p>

<p><a name="IIchap60" id="IIchap60"></a><span class="chapnum">60</span>The most energetic of Otho's centurions were now executed,
which did more than anything else to alienate the armies of
Illyricum. The other legions also caught the infection, and their
dislike of the German troops made them harbour thoughts of war.
Suetonius Paulinus and Licinius Proculus were kept in <a name="fnm352" id="fnm352"></a>mourning<a href="#fn352" class="fnnum">352</a>
and suspense, disheartened by delay. When at last their case was
heard, their pleas savoured more of necessity than honour. They
positively claimed credit for treachery, alleging that the long
march before the battle, the fatigue of their troops, and the
confusion <a name="page168" id="page168" ></a><span class="pagenum">168</span>created by the wagons in their lines were all due not to
chance, but to their own treachery. Vitellius believed their
protestations of treason, and acquitted them of all suspicion of
loyalty.</p>

<p>Otho's brother, Salvius Titianus, was in no danger. His affection
for his brother and his personal inefficiency excused him. Marius
Celsus was allowed to hold his <a name="fnm353" id="fnm353"></a>consulship.<a href="#fn353" class="fnnum">353</a> But rumour gave rise
to a belief which led to an attack being made in the senate against
Caecilius Simplex, who was charged with trying to purchase the
consulship and to secure Celsus' destruction. Vitellius, however,
refused this, and afterwards allowed Simplex to hold the consulship
without detriment to his conscience or his purse. Trachalus was
protected against his accusers by Galeria, Vitellius' <a name="fnm354" id="fnm354"></a>wife.<a href="#fn354" class="fnnum">354</a></p>

<p><a name="IIchap61" id="IIchap61"></a><span class="chapnum">61</span>With so many of the great in danger of their lives, an
obscure creature called Mariccus, of the tribe of the <a name="fnm355" id="fnm355"></a>Boii<a href="#fn355" class="fnnum">355</a>&mdash;it
is a sordid <a name="fnm356" id="fnm356"></a>incident<a href="#fn356" class="fnnum">356</a>&mdash;endeavoured to thrust himself into
greatness and to challenge the armies of Rome, pretending to be a
minister of Heaven. This divine champion of the Gauls, as he had
entitled himself, had already gathered a force of eight thousand
men, and began making <a name="fnm357" id="fnm357"></a>overtures<a href="#fn357" class="fnnum">357</a> to the neighbouring <a name="page169" id="page169" ></a><span class="pagenum">169</span>Aeduan
villages. But the chief community of the Aedui wisely sent out a
picked force, with some Vitellian troops in support, and scattered
the mob of fanatics. Mariccus was captured in the engagement, and
later thrown to wild <a name="fnm358" id="fnm358"></a>beasts.<a href="#fn358" class="fnnum">358</a> As they refused to devour him, the
common people stupidly believed him invulnerable, until he was
executed in the presence of Vitellius.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap62" id="IIchap62"></a><span class="chapnum">62</span>No further measures were taken against the life or property
of the <a name="fnm359" id="fnm359"></a>rebels.<a href="#fn359" class="fnnum">359</a> The estates of those who had fallen fighting for
Otho were allowed to devolve by will or else by the law of intestate
succession. Indeed, if Vitellius had set limits to his luxury, there
was no need to fear his greed for money. It was his foul and
insatiable gluttony. Rome and Italy were scoured for dainties to
tickle his palate: from shore to shore the high roads rang with the
traffic. The leading provincials were ruined by having to provide
for his table. The very towns were impoverished. Meanwhile the
soldiers were acquiring luxurious habits, learning to despise their
general, and gradually losing their former efficiency and courage.</p>

<p>Vitellius sent a manifesto on to Rome in which he declined the title
of Caesar, and postponed calling himself Augustus without giving up
any portion of <a name="page170" id="page170" ></a><span class="pagenum">170</span>his power. All <a name="fnm360" id="fnm360"></a>astrologers<a href="#fn360" class="fnnum">360</a> were exiled from
Italy, and rigorous provision was made to restrain Roman knights
from the disgrace of appearing at the games in the <a name="fnm361" id="fnm361"></a>arena.<a href="#fn361" class="fnnum">361</a>
Former emperors had paid, or more often compelled them to do this,
and many of the provincial towns vied together in hiring the most
profligate young aristocrats.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap63" id="IIchap63"></a><span class="chapnum">63</span>The arrival of his brother and the growing influence of his
tutors in tyranny made Vitellius daily more haughty and cruel. He
gave orders for the execution of Dolabella, whom Otho, as we have
seen,<a name="fnm362" id="fnm362"></a><a href="#fn362" class="fnnum">362</a> had relegated to the colonial town of Aquinum. On hearing
of Otho's death, he had ventured back to Rome. Whereupon an
ex-praetor, named Plancius Varus, one of Dolabella's closest
friends, laid information before the city prefect, Flavius Sabinus,
maintaining that he had broken from custody to put himself at the
head of the defeated party. He added that Dolabella had tried to
tamper with the cohort stationed at <a name="fnm363" id="fnm363"></a>Ostia.<a href="#fn363" class="fnnum">363</a> Having no proof of
these very serious charges, he repented and begged for his friend's
forgiveness. But it was too late. The crime was committed. While
Flavius Sabinus was hesitating what to do in such a serious matter,
Lucius Vitellius' wife, <a name="page171" id="page171" ></a><span class="pagenum">171</span>Triaria, whose cruelty was altogether
unwomanly, terrified him by suggesting that he was trying to get a
reputation for mercy at the expense of his emperor's safety. Sabinus
was naturally of a kindly disposition, but easily changed under the
influence of fear. Though it was not he who was in danger, he was
full of alarms, and hastened Dolabella's impending ruin for fear of
being supposed to have helped him. <a name="IIchap64" id="IIchap64"></a><span class="chapnum">64</span>Vitellius, accordingly,
from motives both of suspicion and of hatred (Dolabella had married
his divorced wife Petronia), summoned Dolabella by letter to avoid
the crowded thoroughfare of the Flaminian road and to turn off to
Interamnium,<a name="fnm364" id="fnm364"></a><a href="#fn364" class="fnnum">364</a> where he gave orders for his murder. The assassin
found the journey tedious; discovered his victim sleeping on the
floor at a wayside inn, and cut his throat. This gave the new
government a very bad name. People took it as a specimen of what to
expect. Triaria's shameless behaviour was further emphasized by the
exemplary behaviour of her relative Galeria, the emperor's wife, who
kept clear of these dreadful doings. Equally admirable was the
character of his mother, Sextilia, a woman of the old school. It was
even on record that when her son's first letters were read to her,
she said, 'It was no <a name="fnm365" id="fnm365"></a>Germanicus,<a href="#fn365" class="fnnum">365</a> but a Vitellius that I brought
into the world.' From that time neither the attractions of her high
station nor the unanimous flattery of Rome could win her over to
complacence. She only shared the sorrows of her house.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap65" id="IIchap65"></a><span class="chapnum">65</span>When Vitellius left Lugdunum, Cluvius <a name="fnm366" id="fnm366"></a>Rufus<a href="#fn366" class="fnnum">366</a>
<a name="page172" id="page172" ></a><span class="pagenum">172</span>relinquished his Spanish province and followed him. He knew that
serious charges had been made against him, and his smiling
congratulations hid an anxious heart. A freedman of the imperial
court,<a name="fnm367" id="fnm367"></a><a href="#fn367" class="fnnum">367</a> Hilarus by name, had given evidence against him,
alleging that, when Cluvius heard of the rival claims of Otho and
Vitellius, he had endeavoured to set up an independent authority of
his own in Spain, and to this end had issued passports with no
emperor's name at the <a name="fnm368" id="fnm368"></a>head.<a href="#fn368" class="fnnum">368</a> Certain phrases in his speeches
were also construed as damaging to Vitellius and as a bid for his
own popularity. However, Cluvius' influence carried the day, and
Vitellius even had his own freedman punished. Cluvius was given a
place at court, while still retaining Spain, of which he was
absentee governor, following the precedent of Lucius Arruntius. In
his case, however, Tiberius' motive had been suspicion, whereas
Vitellius detained Cluvius without any such <a name="fnm369" id="fnm369"></a>qualms.<a href="#fn369" class="fnnum">369</a> Trebellius
<a name="fnm370" id="fnm370"></a>Maximus<a href="#fn370" class="fnnum">370</a> was not allowed the same privilege. He had fled from
Britain to escape the fury of his troops. Vettius Bolanus, who was
then about the court, was sent out to take his place.</p><p><a name="page173" id="page173" ></a><span class="pagenum">173</span></p>

<p><a name="IIchap66" id="IIchap66"></a><span class="chapnum">66</span>The soldiers of the defeated legions still gave Vitellius a
good deal of anxiety. Their spirit was by no means broken. They
distributed themselves all over Italy, mingling with the victors and
talking treason. The most uncompromising of all were the Fourteenth,
who refused to acknowledge their defeat. At Bedriacum, they argued,
it was only a detachment that had been beaten, the main strength of
the legion was not <a name="fnm371" id="fnm371"></a>present.<a href="#fn371" class="fnnum">371</a> It was decided to send them back to
Britain, whence Nero had summoned them, and meanwhile they were to
share their quarters with the Batavian irregulars, because of the
long-standing feud between <a name="fnm372" id="fnm372"></a>them.<a href="#fn372" class="fnnum">372</a> Quartered as they were under
arms, their mutual hatred soon broke out into disorder.</p>

<p>At <a name="fnm373" id="fnm373"></a>Turin<a href="#fn373" class="fnnum">373</a> one of the Batavians was cursing a workman for having
cheated him, when a legionary, who lodged with the workman, took his
part. Each quickly gathered his fellow soldiers round him, and from
abuse they came to bloodshed. Indeed, a fierce battle would have
broken out, unless two regiments of Guards had sided with the
Fourteenth, thus giving them confidence and frightening the
Batavians. Vitellius gave orders that the Batavians should be
drafted into his army, while the legion was to be marched over the
Graian <a name="fnm374" id="fnm374"></a>Alps<a href="#fn374" class="fnnum">374</a> by a d&eacute;tour which would avoid <a name="fnm375" id="fnm375"></a>Vienne.<a href="#fn375" class="fnnum">375</a> Its
inhabitants were another <a name="page174" id="page174" ></a><span class="pagenum">174</span>cause for <a name="fnm376" id="fnm376"></a>alarm.<a href="#fn376" class="fnnum">376</a> On the night on
which the legion started they left fires burning all over Turin, and
part of the town was burnt down. This disaster, like so many others
in the civil war, has been obliterated by the greater calamities
which befell other cities. No sooner were the Fourteenth across the
Alps than the most mutinous spirits started off to march for Vienne,
but they were stopped by the unanimous interference of the better
men, and the legion was shipped across to Britain.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap67" id="IIchap67"></a><span class="chapnum">67</span>Vitellius' next cause of anxiety was the Guards. At first
they were quartered apart, and then, appeased by an honourable
discharge,<a name="fnm377" id="fnm377"></a><a href="#fn377" class="fnnum">377</a> they gave up their arms to their officers. But when
the news went round of the war with Vespasian, they enlisted again
and formed the main strength of the Flavian party.</p>

<p>The First legion of marines was sent to Spain to cultivate docility
in peace and quiet. The Eleventh and the Seventh were sent back to
their winter <a name="fnm378" id="fnm378"></a>quarters.<a href="#fn378" class="fnnum">378</a> The Thirteenth were set to work to build
amphitheatres. For Caecina at Cremona and Valens at Bononia were
each preparing to give a gladiatorial show. Vitellius never let his
anxieties interfere with his pleasures.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap68" id="IIchap68"></a><span class="chapnum">68</span>The losing party being thus dispersed by peaceful means,
disorder broke out in the victorious camp. <a name="page175" id="page175" ></a><span class="pagenum">175</span>It originated in sport,
but the number of deaths increased the feeling against Vitellius. He
had invited Verginius to dine with him at Ticinum, and they had just
sat down to table. The conduct of officers is always determined by
the behaviour of their generals; it depends on that whether they
adopt the simple life or indulge their taste for riotous
living;<a name="fnm379" id="fnm379"></a><a href="#fn379" class="fnnum">379</a> this again determines whether the troops are smart or
disorderly. In Vitellius' army disorder and drunkenness were
universal: it was more like a midnight <a name="fnm380" id="fnm380"></a>orgy<a href="#fn380" class="fnnum">380</a> than a properly
disciplined camp. So it happened that two of the soldiers, one
belonging to the Fifth legion, the other to the Gallic auxiliaries,
in a drunken frolic challenged each other to wrestle. The legionary
fell; and when the Gaul began to exult over him, the soldiers who
had gathered round took sides, and the legionaries, breaking out
against the auxiliaries with murderous intent, actually cut to
pieces a couple of cohorts. This commotion was only cured by
another. A cloud of dust and the glitter of arms appeared on the
horizon. Suddenly a cry arose that the Fourteenth had turned back
and were marching on them. However, it was their own rear-guard
bringing up the stragglers. This discovery quieted their alarm.
Meanwhile, coming across one of Verginius' slaves, they <a name="page176" id="page176" ></a><span class="pagenum">176</span>charged him
with intending to assassinate Vitellius, and rushed off to the
banquet clamouring for Verginius' head. No one really doubted his
innocence, not even Vitellius, who always quailed at a breath of
suspicion. Yet, though it was the death of an ex-consul, their own
former general, which they demanded, it was with difficulty that
they were quieted. No one was a target for these outbreaks so often
as Verginius. He still retained the admiration and esteem of the
men, but they hated him for disdaining their <a name="fnm381" id="fnm381"></a>offer.<a href="#fn381" class="fnnum">381</a></p>

<p><a name="IIchap69" id="IIchap69"></a><span class="chapnum">69</span>On the next day Vitellius granted an audience to the
deputation of the senate, which he had told to await him at Ticinum.
He then entered the camp and spontaneously complimented the troops
on their devotion to <a name="fnm382" id="fnm382"></a>him.<a href="#fn382" class="fnnum">382</a> This made the auxiliaries grumble at
the growing licence and impunity allowed to the legions. So the
Batavians, for fear of some desperate outbreak, were sent back to
Germany, where Fortune was contriving for us a war that was at once
both civil and <a name="fnm383" id="fnm383"></a>foreign.<a href="#fn383" class="fnnum">383</a> The Gallic auxiliaries were also sent
home. Their numbers were very large, and had been used at the first
outbreak of the rebellion for an empty parade of force. Indeed, the
imperial finances were already embarrassed by the distribution of
largess, to meet the expenses of which Vitellius gave orders for
<a name="page177" id="page177" ></a><span class="pagenum">177</span>depleting the strength of the legions and auxiliaries. Recruiting
was forbidden, and discharges offered without restriction. This
policy was disastrous for the country and unpopular among the
soldiers, who found that their turn for work and danger came round
all the more frequently, now that there were so few to share the
duties. Besides, their efficiency was demoralized by luxury. Nothing
was left of the old-fashioned discipline and the good rules of our
ancestors, who preferred to base the security of Rome on character
and not on money.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap70" id="IIchap70"></a><span class="chapnum">70</span>Leaving Ticinum Vitellius turned off to Cremona. There he
witnessed Caecina's games and conceived a wish to stand upon the
field of Bedriacum, and to see the traces of the recent victory with
his own eyes. Within six weeks of the battle, it was a disgusting
and horrible sight; mangled bodies, mutilated limbs, rotting
carcasses of men and horses, the ground foul with clotted blood.
Trees and crops all trampled down: the country-side a miserable
waste. No less revolting to all human feeling was the stretch of
road which the people of Cremona had strewn with laurel-leaves and
roses, erecting altars and sacrificing victims as if in honour of an
Oriental <a name="fnm384" id="fnm384"></a>despot.<a href="#fn384" class="fnnum">384</a> The rejoicings of the moment soon turned to
their <a name="fnm385" id="fnm385"></a>destruction.<a href="#fn385" class="fnnum">385</a> Valens and Caecina were in attendance and
showed Vitellius over the battle-field: this was where their
<a name="page178" id="page178" ></a><span class="pagenum">178</span>legions had charged: the cavalry took the field from here: this was
where the auxiliaries were outflanked. The various <a name="fnm386" id="fnm386"></a>officers<a href="#fn386" class="fnnum">386</a>
each praised their own exploits, adding a few false or, at any rate,
exaggerated touches. The common soldiers, too, turned gaily shouting
from the high road to inspect the scene of their great struggle,
gazing with wonder at the huge pile of arms and heaps of
bodies.<a name="fnm387" id="fnm387"></a><a href="#fn387" class="fnnum">387</a> There were a few who reflected with tears of pity on
the shifting chances of life. But Vitellius never took his eyes off
the field: never shuddered at the sight of all these thousands of
Roman citizens lying <a name="fnm388" id="fnm388"></a>unburied.<a href="#fn388" class="fnnum">388</a> On the contrary, he was very
well pleased, and, unconscious of his own impending doom, he offered
a sacrifice to the local deities.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap71" id="IIchap71"></a><span class="chapnum">71</span>They next came to Bononia, where Fabius Valens gave a
gladiatorial show, for which he had all the apparatus brought from
Rome. The nearer they drew to the city, the greater became the
disorder of the march, which was now joined by troops of actors,
eunuchs and the like, all in the true spirit of Nero's court. For
Vitellius always had a great personal admiration for Nero. He used
to follow him about to hear him sing, not under compulsion&mdash;many a
decent <a name="page179" id="page179" ></a><span class="pagenum">179</span>man suffered that fate&mdash;but because he was the slave of his
stomach, and had sold himself to luxury.</p>

<p>To secure a few months of office for Valens and Caecina, the other
consuls of the <a name="fnm389" id="fnm389"></a>year<a href="#fn389" class="fnnum">389</a> had their terms shortened, while Martius
Macer's claim was ignored as belonging to Otho's party. Valerius
Marinus, who had been nominated by Galba, had his term postponed,
not for any offence, but because he was a mild creature and too lazy
to resent an injury. The name of Pedanius Costa was omitted
altogether. Vitellius had never forgiven him for rising against Nero
and instigating Verginius. However, he alleged other reasons. They
all had to observe the servile custom of the time, and offer their
thanks to Vitellius.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap72" id="IIchap72"></a><span class="chapnum">72</span>An imposture, received at first with great excitement,
failed to last more than a few days. A man had appeared who gave out
that he was Scribonianus <a name="fnm390" id="fnm390"></a>Camerinus,<a href="#fn390" class="fnnum">390</a> and that during Nero's
reign he had taken refuge in Histria, where the Crassi still had
their old connexions and estates, and their name was much respected.
He accordingly took all the rascals he could find and cast them for
parts. The credulous mob and some of the soldiers, who were either
victims of the imposture or anxious for a riot, eagerly flocked to
join him. However, he was taken before Vitellius and his <a name="page180" id="page180" ></a><span class="pagenum">180</span>identity
examined. When it was found that there was no truth in his
pretensions, and that his master recognized him as a runaway called
Geta, he suffered the execution of a <a name="fnm391" id="fnm391"></a>slave.<a href="#fn391" class="fnnum">391</a></p>

<h3><a name="The_Revolt_of_Vespasian" id="The_Revolt_of_Vespasian"></a>The Revolt of Vespasian</h3>

<p><a name="IIchap73" id="IIchap73"></a><span class="chapnum">73</span>When once his couriers brought news from Syria and Judaea
that the East had sworn allegiance to him, Vitellius' vanity and
indolence reached a pitch which is almost incredible. For already,
though the rumours were still vague and unreliable, Vespasian's name
was in everybody's mouth, and the mention of him often roused
Vitellius to alarm. Still, he and his army seemed to reck of no
rival: they at once broke out into the unbridled cruelty, debauchery
and oppression of some outlandish court.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap74" id="IIchap74"></a><span class="chapnum">74</span>Vespasian, on the other hand, was meditating war and
reckoning all his forces both distant and near at hand. He had so
much attached his troops to himself, that when he dictated to them
the oath of allegiance and prayed that 'all might be well' with
Vitellius, they listened in silence. Mucianus' feelings were not
hostile to him, and were strongly sympathetic to Titus. Tiberius
Alexander,<a name="fnm392" id="fnm392"></a><a href="#fn392" class="fnnum">392</a> the Governor of Egypt, had made common cause with
him. The Third <a name="fnm393" id="fnm393"></a>legion,<a href="#fn393" class="fnnum">393</a> since it had crossed from Syria into
Moesia, he could reckon as his own, and there was good hope that the
other legions of Illyria would follow its <a name="fnm394" id="fnm394"></a>lead.<a href="#fn394" class="fnnum">394</a> The whole
<a name="page181" id="page181" ></a><span class="pagenum">181</span>army, indeed, was incensed at the arrogance of Vitellius' soldiers:
truculent in appearance and rough of tongue, they scoffed at all the
other troops as their inferiors. But a war of such magnitude demands
delay. High as were his hopes, Vespasian often calculated his risks.
He realized that it would be a critical day for him when he
committed his sixty summers and his two young sons to the chances of
war. In his private ambitions a man may feel his way and take less
or more from fortune's hands according as he feels inclined, but
when one covets a throne there is no alternative between the zenith
of success and headlong ruin. <a name="IIchap75" id="IIchap75"></a><span class="chapnum">75</span>Moreover, he always kept in
view the strength of the German army, which, as a soldier, he
realized. His own legions, he knew, had no experience of civil war,
while Vitellius' troops were fresh from victory: and the defeated
party were richer in grievances than in troops. Civil strife had
undermined the loyalty of the troops: there was danger in each
single man. What would be the good of all his horse and foot, if one
or two traitors should seek the reward the enemy offered and
assassinate him then and there? It was thus that <a name="fnm395" id="fnm395"></a>Scribonianus<a href="#fn395" class="fnnum">395</a>
had been killed in Claudius' reign, and his murderer, Volaginius,
raised from a common soldier to the highest rank. It is easier to
move men in the mass than to take precautions against them singly.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap76" id="IIchap76"></a><span class="chapnum">76</span>These anxieties made Vespasian hesitate. Meanwhile the
other generals and his friends continued to <a name="page182" id="page182" ></a><span class="pagenum">182</span>encourage him. At last
Mucianus after several private interviews went so far as to address
him in public. 'Everybody,' he said, 'who plans some great exploit
is bound to consider whether his enterprise serves both the public
interest and his own reputation, and whether it is easily
practicable or, at any rate, not impossible. He must also weigh the
advice which he gets. Are those who offer it ready to run the risk
themselves? And, if fortune favours, who gains the glory? I myself,
Vespasian, call you to the throne. How much that may benefit the
country and make you famous it lies with you&mdash;under Providence&mdash;to
decide. You need not be afraid that I may seem to flatter you. It is
more of an insult than a compliment to be chosen to succeed
Vitellius. It is not against the powerful intellect of the sainted
Augustus that we are in revolt; not against the cautious prudence of
the old Tiberius; nor even against a long-established imperial
family like that of Caligula, Claudius or Nero. You even gave way to
Galba's ancient lineage. To remain inactive any longer, to leave
your country to ruin and disgrace, that would be sheer sloth and
cowardice, even if such slavery were as safe for you as it would be
dishonourable. The time is long past when you could be merely
<i>suspected</i> of ambition: the throne is now your only refuge. Have
you forgotten Corbulo's <a name="fnm396" id="fnm396"></a>murder?<a href="#fn396" class="fnnum">396</a> He was a man of better family
than we, I admit, but so <a name="page183" id="page183" ></a><span class="pagenum">183</span>was Nero more nobly born than Vitellius. A
man who is feared always seems illustrious enough to those who fear
him. That an army can make an emperor Vitellius himself has proved.
He had neither experience nor military reputation, but merely rose
on Galba's unpopularity. Even Otho fell not by the strategy or
strength of his opponent, but by his own precipitate despair. And
to-day he seems a great and desirable emperor, when Vitellius is
disbanding his legions, disarming his Guards, and daily sowing fresh
seeds of civil war. Why, any spirit or enthusiasm which his army had
is being dissipated in drunken debauches: for they imitate their
master. But you, in Judaea, in Syria, in Egypt, you have nine fresh
legions. War has not weakened nor mutiny demoralized them. The men
are trained to discipline and have already won a foreign <a name="fnm397" id="fnm397"></a>war.<a href="#fn397" class="fnnum">397</a>
Besides these, you can rely on the strength of your <a name="fnm398" id="fnm398"></a>fleet,<a href="#fn398" class="fnnum">398</a> and
of your auxiliaries both horse and foot, on the faithful allegiance
of foreign <a name="fnm399" id="fnm399"></a>princes,<a href="#fn399" class="fnnum">399</a> and on your own unparalleled experience.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap77" id="IIchap77"></a><span class="chapnum">77</span>'For ourselves I make but one claim. Let us not rank below
Valens and Caecina. Nor must you despise my help because you do not
encounter my rivalry. I prefer myself to Vitellius and you to
myself. Your house has received the insignia of a <a name="fnm400" id="fnm400"></a>triumph.<a href="#fn400" class="fnnum">400</a> You
<a name="page184" id="page184" ></a><span class="pagenum">184</span>have two young sons, one of whom is already old enough to fill the
throne, and in his first years of service made a name for himself in
the German <a name="fnm401" id="fnm401"></a>army.<a href="#fn401" class="fnnum">401</a> It would be absurd for me not to give way to
one whose son I should adopt, were I emperor myself. Apart from
this, we shall stand on a different footing in success and in
failure, for if we succeed I shall have such honour as you grant me:
of the risk and the dangers we shall share the burden equally. Or
rather, do what is better still. Dispose your armies yourself and
leave me the conduct of the war, and the uncertainties of battle.</p>

<p>'At this moment the defeated are far more strictly disciplined than
their conquerors. Indignation, hatred, the passion for revenge, all
serve to steel our courage. Theirs is dulled by pride and mutiny.
The course of the war will soon bring to light the hidden weakness
of their party, and reopen all its festering sores. I rely on your
vigilance, your economy, your wisdom, and still more on the
indolence, ignorance, and cruelty of Vitellius. Above all, our cause
is far safer in war than in peace, for those who plan rebellion have
rebelled already.'</p>

<p><a name="IIchap78" id="IIchap78"></a><span class="chapnum">78</span>At the end of Mucianus' speech the others all pressed round
with new confidence, offering their encouragement and quoting the
answers of soothsayers and the movements of the stars. Nor was
Vespasian uninfluenced by superstition. In later days, when he <a name="page185" id="page185" ></a><span class="pagenum">185</span>was
master of the world, he made no secret of keeping a soothsayer
called Seleucus to help him by his advice and prophecy. Early omens
began to recur to his memory. A tall and conspicuous cypress on his
estate had once suddenly collapsed: on the next day it had risen
again on the same spot to grow taller and broader than ever. The
soothsayers had agreed that this was an omen of great success, and
augured the height of fame for the still youthful Vespasian. At
first his triumphal honours, his consulship, and the name he won by
his Jewish victory seemed to have fulfilled the promise of this
omen. But having achieved all this, he began to believe that it
portended his rise to the throne.</p>

<p>On the frontier of Judaea and <a name="fnm402" id="fnm402"></a>Syria<a href="#fn402" class="fnnum">402</a> lies a hill called Carmel.
A god of the same name is there worshipped according to ancient
ritual. There is no image or temple: only an altar where they
reverently worship. Once when Vespasian was sacrificing on this
altar, brooding on his secret ambition, the priest, Basilides, after
a minute inspection of the omens said to him: 'Whatever it is which
you have in mind, Vespasian, whether it is to build a house or to
enlarge your estate, or to increase the number of your slaves, there
is granted to you a great habitation, vast acres, and a multitude of
men.' Rumour had immediately seized on this riddle and now began to
solve it. Nothing was more talked of, especially in Vespasian's
presence: such conversation is the food of hope.</p><p><a name="page186" id="page186" ></a><span class="pagenum">186</span></p>

<p>Having come to a definite decision they departed, Mucianus to
Antioch, Vespasian to Caesarea. The former is the capital of Syria,
the latter of <a name="fnm403" id="fnm403"></a>Judaea.<a href="#fn403" class="fnnum">403</a></p>

<p><a name="IIchap79" id="IIchap79"></a><span class="chapnum">79</span>The first offer of the throne to Vespasian was made at
Alexandria, where Tiberius Alexander with great promptitude
administered the oath of allegiance to his troops on the first of
July. This was usually celebrated as his day of accession, although
it was not until the third that the Jewish army took the oath in his
presence. So eager was their enthusiasm that they would not even
wait for the arrival of Titus, who was on his way back from Syria,
where he had been conducting the negotiations between his father and
Mucianus.</p>

<p>What happened was all due to the impulse of the soldiers: there was
no set speech, no formal assembly of the troops. <a name="IIchap80" id="IIchap80"></a><span class="chapnum">80</span>They were
still discussing the time and the place, and trying to decide the
hardest point of all, who should speak first, and while their minds
were still busy with hopes and fears, reasons and chances, Vespasian
happened to come out of his quarters. A few of the soldiers, forming
up in the usual way to salute their general, saluted him as emperor.
The others promptly rushed up calling him Caesar and Augustus, and
heaping on him all the imperial titles. Their fears at once gave way
to confidence. Vespasian himself, unchanged by the change of
fortune, showed <a name="page187" id="page187" ></a><span class="pagenum">187</span>no sign of vanity or arrogance. As soon as he had
recovered from the dazzling shock of his sudden elevation, he
addressed them in simple soldier fashion, and received a shower of
congratulations from every quarter. Mucianus, who had been waiting
for this, administered the oath of allegiance to his eager troops,
and then entered the theatre at Antioch, where the Greeks ordinarily
hold their debates. There, as the fawning crowd came flocking in, he
addressed them in their own tongue. For he could speak elegant
Greek, and had the art of making the most of all he said or did.
What most served to inflame the excitement of the province and of
the army, was his statement that Vitellius had determined to
transfer the German legions to peaceful service in the rich province
of Syria, and to send the Syrian legions to endure the toil and
rigours of a winter in Germany. The provincials were accustomed to
the soldiers' company and liked to have them quartered there, and
many were bound to them by ties of intimacy and kinship, while the
soldiers in their long term of service had come to know and love
their old camp like a home.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap81" id="IIchap81"></a><span class="chapnum">81</span>Before the 15th of July the whole of Syria had sworn
allegiance. The party also gained the support of <a name="fnm404" id="fnm404"></a>Sohaemus,<a href="#fn404" class="fnnum">404</a> with
all the resources of his kingdom and a considerable force, and of
Antiochus,<a href="#fn404" class="fnnum">404</a> the richest of the subject princes, who owed his
importance to his ancestral treasures. Before long Agrippa, too,
received a secret summons from his friends at home, and leaving
<a name="page188" id="page188" ></a><span class="pagenum">188</span>Rome<a name="fnm405" id="fnm405"></a><a href="#fn405" class="fnnum">405</a> without the knowledge of Vitellius, sailed as fast as he
could to join Vespasian. His sister <a name="fnm406" id="fnm406"></a>Berenice<a href="#fn406" class="fnnum">406</a> showed equal
enthusiasm for the cause. She was then in the flower of her youth
and beauty, and her munificent gifts to Vespasian quite won the old
man's heart. Indeed, every province on the seaboard as far as Asia
and Achaia, and inland to Pontus and Armenia swore allegiance to
Vespasian, but their governors were without troops, for as yet no
legions had been assigned to <a name="fnm407" id="fnm407"></a>Cappadocia.<a href="#fn407" class="fnnum">407</a></p>

<p>A meeting was held at <a name="fnm408" id="fnm408"></a>Berytus<a href="#fn408" class="fnnum">408</a> to discuss the general situation.
To this came Mucianus with all his officers and the most
distinguished of his centurions and soldiers, besides the elite of
the Jewish army in full uniform. All these cavalry and infantry, and
the pageant of the subject princes, vying with each other in
splendour, gave the meeting an air of imperial grandeur.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap82" id="IIchap82"></a><span class="chapnum">82</span>The first step was to levy new troops and to recall the
veterans to the standards. Some of the strongest towns were told off
to manufacture arms. New gold and silver were coined at Antioch. All
these works were promptly carried out, each in the proper place, by
competent officials. Vespasian came and inspected them himself,
encouraging good work by his praises <a name="page189" id="page189" ></a><span class="pagenum">189</span>and rousing the inefficient
rather by example than compulsion, always more ready to see the
merits than the faults of his friends. Many were rewarded by
receiving commands in the auxiliary forces or posts as imperial
agents.<a name="fnm409" id="fnm409"></a><a href="#fn409" class="fnnum">409</a> Still more were raised to senatorial rank. They were
mostly men of distinction who soon rose high, and with others
success atoned for any lack of merit. A donation for the troops had
been mentioned by Mucianus in his first speech, but in very guarded
terms. Even Vespasian offered for the civil war a lower figure than
others gave in time of peace, for he had set his face with admirable
firmness against largess to the soldiers, and his army was none the
worse for it. Envoys were dispatched to Parthia and Armenia to
secure that the legions, while engaged in the civil war, should not
be exposed to attack in the <a name="fnm410" id="fnm410"></a>rear.<a href="#fn410" class="fnnum">410</a> It was arranged that Titus
should carry on the war in Judaea, while Vespasian held the keys of
Egypt.<a name="fnm411" id="fnm411"></a><a href="#fn411" class="fnnum">411</a> Against Vitellius it seemed sufficient to send a part of
their forces under the command of Mucianus. He would have
Vespasian's name behind him and the <a name="page190" id="page190" ></a><span class="pagenum">190</span>irresistible force of destiny.
Letters were written to all the armies and their generals with
instructions that they should try to win over those of the Guards
who were hostile to Vitellius by promising them renewal of service.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap83" id="IIchap83"></a><span class="chapnum">83</span>Meanwhile, Mucianus, who acted the part more of a partner
than a subordinate, moved forward without the encumbrance of
baggage, neither marching so slowly as to look like holding back,
nor so rapidly as not to allow time for rumours to spread. He
realized that his force was small, and that the less people saw the
more they would believe of it. However, he had a solid column
following in support, composed of the Sixth legion and some picked
detachments numbering 13,000 <a name="fnm412" id="fnm412"></a>men.<a href="#fn412" class="fnnum">412</a> He had ordered the fleet to
move from Pontus to Byzantium, for he was half-minded to leave
Moesia and with his whole force to hold Dyrrachium, at the same time
using his fleet to dominate the Italian sea. He would thus secure
Greece and Asia in his rear, which would otherwise be at the mercy
of Vitellius, unless furnished with troops. Vitellius also would
himself be in doubt what points of the Italian coast to defend, if
Mucianus with his ships threatened both Brundisium and Tarentum and
the whole coastline of Calabria and Lucania.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap84" id="IIchap84"></a><span class="chapnum">84</span>Thus the provinces rang from end to end with the
preparations for ships, soldiers and arms. But the <a name="page191" id="page191" ></a><span class="pagenum">191</span>heaviest burden
was the raising of money. 'Funds,' said Mucianus, 'are the sinews of
war,'<a name="fnm413" id="fnm413"></a><a href="#fn413" class="fnnum">413</a> and in his investigations he cared for neither justice
nor equity, but solely for the amount of the sum. Informers
abounded, and pounced on every rich man as their prey. This
intolerable oppression, excused by the necessities of war, was
allowed to continue even in peace. It was not so much that Vespasian
at the beginning of his reign had made up his mind to maintain
unjust decisions, but fortune spoilt him; he had learnt in a bad
school and made a bold use of his lessons. Mucianus also contributed
from his private means, of which he was generous, as he hoped to get
a high rate of interest out of the country. Others followed his
example, but very few had his opportunity of recovering their money.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap85" id="IIchap85"></a><span class="chapnum">85</span>In the meantime Vespasian's progress was accelerated by the
enthusiasm with which the Illyrian <a name="fnm414" id="fnm414"></a>army<a href="#fn414" class="fnnum">414</a> espoused his cause. The
Third set the example to the other legions of Moesia, the Eighth and
the Seventh Claudian, both strongly attached to Otho, although they
had not been present at the battle. On their arrival at
<a name="fnm415" id="fnm415"></a>Aquileia<a href="#fn415" class="fnnum">415</a> they had mobbed the couriers who brought the news of
Otho's fall, and torn to pieces the standards bearing Vitellius'
name, finally looting the camp-chest and dividing the money among
themselves. <a name="page192" id="page192" ></a><span class="pagenum">192</span>These were hostile acts. Alarmed at what they had done
they began to reflect that, while their conduct needed excuse before
Vitellius, they could make a merit of it with Vespasian.
Accordingly, the three Moesian legions addressed letters to the
Pannonian <a name="fnm416" id="fnm416"></a>army,<a href="#fn416" class="fnnum">416</a> inviting their co-operation, and meanwhile
prepared to meet refusal with force.</p>

<p>Aponius Saturninus, the Governor of Moesia, took this opportunity to
attempt an abominable crime. He sent a centurion to murder Tettius
Julianus,<a name="fnm417" id="fnm417"></a><a href="#fn417" class="fnnum">417</a> who commanded the Seventh legion, alleging the
interests of his party as a cloak for a personal quarrel. Julianus
heard of his danger and, taking some guides who knew the country,
escaped into the wilds of Moesia and got as far as Mount
Haemus.<a name="fnm418" id="fnm418"></a><a href="#fn418" class="fnnum">418</a> After that he meddled no more in civil war. Starting to
join Vespasian, he prolonged his journey by various expedients,
retarding or hastening his pace according to the nature of the news
he received.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap86" id="IIchap86"></a><span class="chapnum">86</span>In Pannonia the Thirteenth legion and the Seventh Galbian
had not forgotten their feelings after the battle of Bedriacum. They
lost no time in joining Vespasian's cause, being chiefly instigated
by Antonius Primus. This man was a criminal who had been convicted
of <a name="fnm419" id="fnm419"></a>fraud<a href="#fn419" class="fnnum">419</a> during Nero's reign. Among the many evils of the war
was his recovery of senatorial <a name="page193" id="page193" ></a><span class="pagenum">193</span>rank. Galba gave him command of the
Seventh legion, and he was believed to have written repeatedly to
Otho offering his services as general to the party. But, as Otho
took no notice of him, he was without employment in the war. When
Vitellius' cause began to decline, he joined Vespasian and proved an
acquisition. He was a man of great physical energy and a ready
tongue; an artist in calumny, invaluable in riots and sedition.
Light-fingered and free-handed, he was intolerable in peace, but by
no means contemptible in war. The union of the Moesian and Pannonian
armies soon attracted the troops in Dalmatia to the cause. Tampius
Flavianus and Pompeius Silvanus, the two ex-consuls who governed
respectively Pannonia and <a name="fnm420" id="fnm420"></a>Dalmatia,<a href="#fn420" class="fnnum">420</a> were wealthy old gentlemen
who had no thought of rising. But the imperial agent in Pannonia,
Cornelius Fuscus, was a vigorous young man of good family. In his
early youth a desire to make <a name="fnm421" id="fnm421"></a>money<a href="#fn421" class="fnnum">421</a> had led him to resign his
senatorial rank. He <a name="page194" id="page194" ></a><span class="pagenum">194</span>had headed the townsmen of his colony in
declaring for Galba, and his services had won him a position as
imperial <a name="fnm422" id="fnm422"></a>agent.<a href="#fn422" class="fnnum">422</a> Then he joined Vespasian's party, giving a keen
stimulus to the war; for, being attracted more by danger itself than
by its prizes, he always disliked what was certain and long
established, preferring everything that was new and dangerous and
doubtful. So the Vespasian party used all their efforts to fan every
spark of discontent throughout the empire. Letters were sent to the
Fourteenth in Britain and to the First in <a name="fnm423" id="fnm423"></a>Spain,<a href="#fn423" class="fnnum">423</a> since both
these legions had stood for Otho against Vitellius. In Gaul, too,
letters were scattered broadcast. All in an instant the war was in
full flame. The armies of Illyricum openly revolted, and all the
others were ready to follow the first sign of success.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap87" id="IIchap87"></a><span class="chapnum">87</span>While<a name="fnm424" id="fnm424"></a><a href="#fn424" class="fnnum">424</a> Vespasian and his generals were showing such
activity in the provinces, Vitellius grew more contemptible and
indolent every day. Halting at every town or country house that
offered any attractions, he made his way to Rome with a heavy
marching column of sixty thousand troops, demoralized by loose
discipline, and an even greater number of menials as well as those
camp-followers who are more troublesome than any slaves. Besides
these he had the vast retinue of his generals and friends, which not
even the strictest discipline could have kept under control. This
mob <a name="page195" id="page195" ></a><span class="pagenum">195</span>was further encumbered by senators and knights, who came from
Rome to meet him, some from fear, some from servility; and gradually
all the others followed, so as not to be left behind by themselves.
There flocked in, too, a crowd of low-bred buffoons, actors and
chariot-drivers, who had gained Vitellius' acquaintance by various
dishonest services. He delighted in such discreditable connexions.
To furnish supplies for this host not only were the colonies and
country towns laid under contribution, but the farmers as well. The
crops were just ripe and the fields were ravaged like an enemy's
country.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap88" id="IIchap88"></a><span class="chapnum">88</span>Many murderous affrays took place among the soldiers, for
after the mutiny at <a name="fnm425" id="fnm425"></a>Ticinum<a href="#fn425" class="fnnum">425</a> there were ceaseless quarrels
between the legions and the auxiliaries. They only united to harry
the villagers. The worst bloodshed took place at the seventh
milestone from Rome. Here Vitellius had ready-cooked food served to
each of the soldiers, as is done with gladiators in training, and
the common people flocked out from Rome and wandered all over the
camp. Some of these visitors indulged in a cockney practical
joke,<a name="fnm426" id="fnm426"></a><a href="#fn426" class="fnnum">426</a> and stole some of the soldiers' swords, quietly cutting
their belts while their attention was diverted. Then they kept
asking them, 'Have you got your sword <a name="page196" id="page196" ></a><span class="pagenum">196</span>on?' The troops were not used
to being laughed at, and refused to tolerate it. They charged the
defenceless crowd. Amongst others the father of one of the soldiers
was killed while in his son's company. When it was discovered who he
was, and the news spread, they shed no more innocent blood. Still
there was some panic in the city as the first soldiers arrived and
began to roam the streets. They mostly made for the Forum, anxious
to see the spot where Galba had <a name="fnm427" id="fnm427"></a>fallen.<a href="#fn427" class="fnnum">427</a> They themselves were a
sufficiently alarming sight with their rough skin coats and long
pikes. Unused to towns, they failed to pick their way in the crowd;
or they would slip on the greasy streets, or collide with some one
and tumble down, whereupon they took to abuse and before long to
violence. Their officers, too, terrified the city by sweeping along
the streets with their bands of armed men.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap89" id="IIchap89"></a><span class="chapnum">89</span>After crossing the Mulvian bridge, Vitellius himself had
been riding on a conspicuous horse, wearing his sword and general's
uniform, with the senate and people trooping in front of him.
However, as this looked too much like an entry into a captured city,
his friends persuaded him to change into civilian dress and walk on
foot. At the head of his column were carried the eagles of four
legions, surrounded by the colours belonging to the detachments of
four other <a name="fnm428" id="fnm428"></a>legions.<a href="#fn428" class="fnnum">428</a> Next came the standards of twelve regiments
of <a name="page197" id="page197" ></a><span class="pagenum">197</span>auxiliary horse, then the files of infantry and the cavalry
behind them. Then came thirty-four cohorts of auxiliaries, arranged
according to their nationality or the nature of their weapons. In
front of the eagles came the camp prefects and tribunes, and the
senior <a name="fnm429" id="fnm429"></a>centurions,<a href="#fn429" class="fnnum">429</a> all dressed in white. The other centurions
marched each at the head of his company, glittering with their
armour and decorations. Gaily, too, shone the soldiers' <a name="fnm430" id="fnm430"></a>medals<a href="#fn430" class="fnnum">430</a>
and their chains of honour. It was a noble spectacle, an army worthy
of a better emperor. Thus Vitellius entered the Capitol, where he
embraced his mother and conferred on her the title of Augusta.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap90" id="IIchap90"></a><span class="chapnum">90</span>On the following day Vitellius delivered a grandiloquent
eulogy on his own merits. He might have been addressing the senate
and people of some other state, for he extolled his own industry and
self-control, although each member of his audience had seen his
infamy for himself, and the whole of Italy had witnessed during his
march the shameful spectacle of his sloth and luxury. However, the
thoughtless crowd could not discriminate between truth and
falsehood. They had learnt the usual flatteries by heart and chimed
in with loud shouts of applause. They insisted in the face of his
protests that he should take the title of <a name="page198" id="page198" ></a><span class="pagenum">198</span>Augustus. But neither his
refusal nor their insistence made much <a name="fnm431" id="fnm431"></a>difference.<a href="#fn431" class="fnnum">431</a></p>

<p><a name="IIchap91" id="IIchap91"></a><span class="chapnum">91</span>In Rome nothing passes without comment, and it was regarded
as a fatal omen that Vitellius took office as high priest, and
issued his encyclical on public worship on the 18th of July, which,
as the anniversary of the disasters on the Cremera and the
Allia,<a name="fnm432" id="fnm432"></a><a href="#fn432" class="fnnum">432</a> had long been considered an unlucky day. But his
ignorance of all civil and religious precedent was only equalled by
the incapacity of his freedmen and friends. He seemed to live in a
society of drunkards. However, at the consular elections he
canvassed for his candidates like a common <a name="fnm433" id="fnm433"></a>citizen.<a href="#fn433" class="fnnum">433</a> In
everything he courted the favour of the lowest classes, attending
performances in the theatre and backing his favourite at the races.
This would undoubtedly have made him popular had his motives been
good, but the memory of his former life made his conduct seem cheap
and discreditable. He constantly attended the senate, even when the
debates were on trivial matters. It once happened that Helvidius
Priscus,<a name="fnm434" id="fnm434"></a><a href="#fn434" class="fnnum">434</a> then praetor-elect, opposed Vitellius' policy. At
first the emperor showed annoyance, <a name="page199" id="page199" ></a><span class="pagenum">199</span>but was content to appeal to
the tribunes of the people to come to the rescue of his slighted
authority. Afterwards, when his friends, fearing that his resentment
might be deep-seated, tried to smooth matters, he replied that there
was nothing strange in two senators disagreeing on a question of
public policy: he himself had often opposed even such a man as
Thrasea. Most people laughed at the impudence of this comparison;
others were gratified that he had selected Thrasea, and not some
court favourite, as an example of real <a name="fnm435" id="fnm435"></a>distinction.<a href="#fn435" class="fnnum">435</a></p>

<p><a name="IIchap92" id="IIchap92"></a><span class="chapnum">92</span>Vitellius had given the command of the Guards to Publilius
Sabinus, who had commanded an auxiliary <a name="fnm436" id="fnm436"></a>cohort,<a href="#fn436" class="fnnum">436</a> and Julius
Priscus, hitherto only a centurion. Priscus owed his rise to Valens'
support, Sabinus to that of Caecina. The rivalry between Valens and
Caecina left Vitellius no authority at all. They managed the
government between them. They had long felt the strain of mutual
dislike. During the war they had concealed it. Lately it had been
fanned by dishonest friends and by life in the city, which so easily
breeds quarrels. They were constant rivals, comparing their
respective popularity, the number of their retinue, the size of the
crowds that came to wait upon them. <a name="page200" id="page200" ></a><span class="pagenum">200</span>Meanwhile Vitellius let his
favour alternate between them, for personal influence is not to be
trusted beyond a certain limit. Meanwhile, they both feared and
despised the emperor himself, who thus veered between sudden
brusqueness and unseasonable flattery. However, they were not in the
least deterred from seizing on the houses, gardens, and funds in the
emperor's patronage, while the crowd of miserable and needy nobles,
whom Galba had recalled from exile with their children, derived no
assistance from the emperor's liberality. He earned the approval
both of the upper classes and of the people by granting to the
restored full rights over their <a name="fnm437" id="fnm437"></a>freedmen.<a href="#fn437" class="fnnum">437</a> But the freed slaves
with characteristic meanness did all they could to invalidate the
edict. They would hide their money with some obscure friend or in a
rich patron's safe. Some, indeed, had passed into the imperial
household and become more influential than their masters.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap93" id="IIchap93"></a><span class="chapnum">93</span>As for the soldiers, the Guards' barracks were crowded, and
the overflow spread through the city, finding shelter in colonnades
and temples. They ceased to recognize any head-quarters, to go on
guard, or to keep themselves in training, but fell victims to the
attractions of city life and its unmentionable vices, until they
deteriorated both physically and morally through idleness and
debauchery. A number of them <a name="page201" id="page201" ></a><span class="pagenum">201</span>even imperilled their lives by
settling in the pestilent Vatican quarter, thus increasing the rate
of mortality. They were close to the Tiber, and the Germans and
Gauls, who were peculiarly liable to disease and could ill stand the
heat, ruined their constitutions by their immoderate use of the
river.<a name="fnm438" id="fnm438"></a><a href="#fn438" class="fnnum">438</a> Moreover, the generals, either for bribes or to earn
popularity, tampered with the rules of the service, enrolling
sixteen regiments of <a name="fnm439" id="fnm439"></a>Guards<a href="#fn439" class="fnnum">439</a> and four for the city garrison,
each composed of a thousand men. In enlisting these troops Valens
put himself forward as superior to Caecina, whose life he claimed to
have saved. It is true, indeed, that his arrival had consolidated
the party, and by his successful engagement he had silenced the
current criticism of their slow marching. Besides which the whole of
the army of Lower Germany was attached to Valens, and this is said
to be the reason why Caecina's loyalty first wavered.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap94" id="IIchap94"></a><span class="chapnum">94</span>Whatever indulgence Vitellius showed to his generals, he
allowed still more licence to the troops. Each man chose his
service. However unfit, he might enlist in <a name="page202" id="page202" ></a><span class="pagenum">202</span>the Guards, if he
preferred it. On the other hand, good soldiers were allowed, if they
wished, to remain in the legions or the auxiliary cavalry. Many
wished to do this who suffered from ill health and complained of the
climate. However, the best soldiers were thus withdrawn from the
legions and from the cavalry; and the Guards were robbed of their
prestige when twenty thousand men were thus not so much selected for
service with them as drafted at random from the whole army.</p>

<p>While Vitellius was addressing the troops, they demanded the
execution of three Gallic chieftains, Asiaticus, Flavus, and
Rufinus, on the ground that they had fought for <a name="fnm440" id="fnm440"></a>Vindex.<a href="#fn440" class="fnnum">440</a>
Vitellius never checked these outcries. For, apart from the innate
cowardice of his nature, he knew that his donation to the soldiers
was nearly due, and that he had no money for it; so he freely
granted all their other demands. The imperial freedmen were forced
to contribute a sort of tax, proportionate to the number of their
slaves. Meanwhile, his one serious occupation was extravagance. He
built stables for chariot-drivers, filled the arena with gorgeous
shows of gladiators and wild beasts, and fooled away his money as
though he had more than he wanted.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap95" id="IIchap95"></a><span class="chapnum">95</span>Moreover, Valens and Caecina celebrated Vitellius'
<a name="fnm441" id="fnm441"></a>birthday<a href="#fn441" class="fnnum">441</a> by holding gladiatorial shows in every quarter of Rome
on a scale of magnificence hitherto unknown. Vitellius then
gratified the rabble and scandalized all decent people by building
altars in the Martian Plain, and holding a funeral service in honour
of Nero. Victims were killed and burnt in public: the torch was
applied by the Augustales, members of the college which Tiberius
Caesar had founded in honour <a name="page203" id="page203" ></a><span class="pagenum">203</span>of the Julian family, just as Romulus
similarly commemorated King Tatius.</p>

<p>It was not yet four months since Vitellius' victory, and yet his
freedman Asiaticus was as bad as a Polyclitus or a <a name="fnm442" id="fnm442"></a>Patrobius,<a href="#fn442" class="fnnum">442</a>
or any of the favourites whose names were hated in earlier days. At
this court no one strove to rise by honesty or capacity. There was
only one road to power. By lavish banquets, costly profusion, and
feats of gastronomy, you had to try and satisfy Vitellius'
insatiable gluttony. He himself, without thought for the morrow, was
well content to enjoy the present. It is believed that he squandered
nine hundred million <a name="fnm443" id="fnm443"></a>sesterces<a href="#fn443" class="fnnum">443</a> in these brief months. Truly it
shows Rome's greatness and misfortune, that she endured Otho and
Vitellius both in the same year, and suffered humiliation of every
kind at the hands of men like Vinius and <a name="fnm444" id="fnm444"></a>Fabius,<a href="#fn444" class="fnnum">444</a> Icelus and
Asiaticus, until at last they gave way to Mucianus and Marcellus&mdash;a
change of men but not of manners.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap96" id="IIchap96"></a><span class="chapnum">96</span>The first news of rebellion which reached Vitellius came
from Aponius <a name="fnm445" id="fnm445"></a>Saturninus,<a href="#fn445" class="fnnum">445</a> who, before himself going over to
Vespasian's side, wrote to announce the desertion of the Third
legion. But a sudden crisis makes a man nervous: Aponius did not
tell the whole story. So the emperor's flattering friends began to
explain it all away: what was the defection of a single legion,
while the loyalty of the other armies remained <a name="page204" id="page204" ></a><span class="pagenum">204</span>unshaken? Vitellius
himself used the same language to the soldiers. He accused the men,
who had been recently discharged from the <a name="fnm446" id="fnm446"></a>Guards,<a href="#fn446" class="fnnum">446</a> of spreading
false rumours, and kept assuring them there was no fear of civil
war. All mention of Vespasian was suppressed, and soldiers were sent
round the city to frighten people into silence, which, of course,
did more than anything else to make them talk.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap97" id="IIchap97"></a><span class="chapnum">97</span>Vitellius, nevertheless, sent for reinforcements from
Germany, Britain, and the Spanish provinces, though with a lack of
urgency which was intended to conceal his straits. The provinces and
their governors showed the same want of enthusiasm. Hordeonius
Flaccus,<a name="fnm447" id="fnm447"></a><a href="#fn447" class="fnnum">447</a> who had suspicions of the Batavi, was distracted with
a war of his <a name="fnm448" id="fnm448"></a>own,<a href="#fn448" class="fnnum">448</a> while Vettius <a name="fnm449" id="fnm449"></a>Bolanus<a href="#fn449" class="fnnum">449</a> never had Britain
under complete control: nor was the loyally of either beyond doubt.
The Spanish provinces, where there was at the time no consular
governor,<a name="fnm450" id="fnm450"></a><a href="#fn450" class="fnnum">450</a> were equally slow. The three officers in command of
the legions held an equal authority, and if Vitellius' cause had
prospered, would have each outbid the other for his favour: but they
all shared the resolve to leave his misfortunes alone. In Africa the
legion and auxiliaries enlisted by Clodius Macer, and subsequently
<a name="page205" id="page205" ></a><span class="pagenum">205</span>disbanded by <a name="fnm451" id="fnm451"></a>Galba,<a href="#fn451" class="fnnum">451</a> took service again at Vitellius' orders,
and at the same time all the young men of the province eagerly
enlisted. Vitellius had been an honest and popular pro-consul in
Africa, while Vespasian had been distrusted and disliked. The
provincials took this as an earnest of their reigns; but experience
proved them wrong.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap98" id="IIchap98"></a><span class="chapnum">98</span>The military legate Valerius <a name="fnm452" id="fnm452"></a>Festus<a href="#fn452" class="fnnum">452</a> at first loyally
seconded the enthusiasm of the province. After a while he began to
waver. In his official letters and edicts he still acknowledged
Vitellius, while in secret communication with Vespasian and ready to
support whichever party proved successful. In Raetia and the Gallic
provinces some centurions and men carrying letters and edicts from
Vespasian were taken prisoners and sent to Vitellius, who had them
executed. But most of these envoys escaped capture either by their
own ingenuity or the loyal help of friends. Thus, while Vitellius'
plans were known, Vespasian's were for the most part still a secret.
This was partly due to Vitellius' negligence, but also to the fact
that the garrisons on the Pannonian Alps stopped all messengers. By
sea, too, the <a name="fnm453" id="fnm453"></a>Etesian<a href="#fn453" class="fnnum">453</a> winds from the north-west favoured ships
sailing eastward, but hindered the voyage from the East.</p><p><a name="page206" id="page206" ></a><span class="pagenum">206</span></p>

<p><a name="IIchap99" id="IIchap99"></a><span class="chapnum">99</span>Terrified at last by the imminence of invasion and the
alarming news that reached him from all quarters, Vitellius
instructed Caecina and Valens to prepare for war. Caecina was sent
on ahead, Valens, who was just recovering from a serious illness,
being delayed by his weak state of health. Great, indeed, was the
change in the appearance of the German army as it marched out of
Rome. There was neither energy in their muscles nor fire in their
hearts. Slowly the column straggled on, their horses spiritless,
their arms neglected. The men grumbled at the sun, the dust, the
weather, and were as ready to quarrel as they were unwilling to
work. To these disadvantages were added Caecina's inveterate
self-seeking and his newly-acquired indolence. An overdose of
success had made him slack and self-indulgent, or, if he was
plotting treachery, this may have been one of his devices for
demoralizing the army. It has often been believed that it was
Flavius <a name="fnm454" id="fnm454"></a>Sabinus<a href="#fn454" class="fnnum">454</a> who, using Rubrius Gallus as his agent,
tampered with Caecina's loyalty by promising that, if he came over,
Vespasian would ratify any conditions. It may have occurred also to
Caecina to remember his quarrels and rivalry with Valens, and to
consider that, as he did not stand first with Vitellius, he had
better acquire credit and influence with the new emperor.</p>

<p><a name="IIchap100" id="IIchap100"></a><span class="chapnum">100</span>After taking an affectionate and respectful farewell of
Vitellius, Caecina dispatched a body of cavalry to occupy Cremona.
He soon followed with the <a name="page207" id="page207" ></a><span class="pagenum">207</span>detachments of the First, Fourth,
Fifteenth, and Sixteenth legions in the van. The centre was composed
of the Fifth and Twenty-second, and in the rear of the column came
the Twenty-first Rapax and the First Italian legion, with
detachments from the three legions of Britain and a select force of
auxiliaries. When Caecina had started, Valens wrote instructions to
the legions belonging to his old <a name="fnm455" id="fnm455"></a>command<a href="#fn455" class="fnnum">455</a> to await him on the
march, saying that he and Caecina had arranged this. Caecina,
however, took advantage of being on the spot, and pretended that
this plan had been altered so as to enable them to meet the first
outbreak of the war with their full strength. So some legions were
hurried forward to <a name="fnm456" id="fnm456"></a>Cremona<a href="#fn456" class="fnnum">456</a> and part of the force was directed
upon <a name="fnm457" id="fnm457"></a>Hostilia.<a href="#fn457" class="fnnum">457</a> Caecina himself turned aside to Ravenna on the
pretext of giving instructions to the fleet. Thence he proceeded to
<a name="fnm458" id="fnm458"></a>Patavium<a href="#fn458" class="fnnum">458</a> to secure secrecy for his treacherous designs. For
Lucilius Bassus, whom Vitellius, from a prefect of auxiliary cavalry
had raised to the supreme command of the two fleets at Ravenna and
Misenum, felt aggrieved at not being immediately given the
praefecture of the Guards, and sought in dastardly treachery the
remedy for his unjustifiable annoyance. It can never be known
whether he influenced Caecina or whether one was as dishonest as the
other. There is seldom much to <a name="page208" id="page208" ></a><span class="pagenum">208</span>choose between rascals.
<a name="IIchap101" id="IIchap101"></a><span class="chapnum">101</span>The <a name="fnm459" id="fnm459"></a>historians<a href="#fn459" class="fnnum">459</a> who compiled the records of this war
in the days of the Flavian dynasty were led by flattery into
adducing as the causes of the rebellion patriotism and the interests
of peace. We cannot think them right. Apart from the innate
disloyalty of the rebels and the loss of character after Galba's
betrayal, they seem to have been led by jealousy and rivalry into
sacrificing Vitellius himself for fear that they might lose the
first place in his favour. Thus when Caecina joined his <a name="fnm460" id="fnm460"></a>army,<a href="#fn460" class="fnnum">460</a>
he used every device to undermine the staunch fidelity of the
centurions and soldiers to Vitellius. Bassus found the same task
less difficult, for the fleet remembered that they had lately been
in Otho's service, and were therefore already on the brink of
rebellion.</p>
