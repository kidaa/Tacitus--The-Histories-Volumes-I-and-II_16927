reinforcements and prolonging the war dwelt on the strength and
reputation of the German legions, and pointed out that the flower of
the British army had lately arrived in Rome with Vitellius;<a name="fnm2" id="fnm2"></a><a href="#fn2" class="fnnum">2</a> their
own forces were numerically inferior and had recently suffered
defeat; moreover, conquered troops, however bold their language,
never show the same courage. On the other hand, if they occupied the
Alps, Mucianus would soon arrive with the forces from the East.
Besides, Vespasian <a name="fnm3" id="fnm3"></a>still<a href="#fn3" class="fnnum">3</a> commanded the sea, and could count on
the support of the <a name="fnm4" id="fnm4"></a>fleets<a href="#fn4" class="fnnum">4</a> and of the provinces, <a name="page10" id="page10" ></a><span class="pagenum">10</span>where he could
still raise material for a sort of second war. A salutary delay
would bring them fresh forces without in any way prejudicing their
present position.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap2" id="IIIchap2"></a><span class="chapnum">2</span>In answer to these arguments Antonius <a name="fnm5" id="fnm5"></a>Primus,<a href="#fn5" class="fnnum">5</a> who had
done more than any one else to stir up the war, stoutly maintained
that prompt action would save them and ruin Vitellius. 'Their
victory,' he said, 'has not served to inspirit but to enervate them.
The men are not held in readiness in camp, but are loitering in
towns all over Italy. No one but their hosts has any call to fear
them. The more unruly and ferocious they showed themselves before,
the greater the greed with which they now indulge in unwonted
draughts of pleasure. The circus, the theatre, and the charms of the
capital have ruined their hardness and their health. But if we give
them time to train for war they will regain their energy. It is not
far to Germany, whence they draw their main strength. Britain is
only separated by a narrow channel. Close at hand they have Gaul and
Spain, from the provinces of which they can get men, horses, and
subsidies. Then again, they can rely on Italy itself and all the
resources of the capital, while, if they want to take the offensive,
they have two <a name="fnm6" id="fnm6"></a>fleets<a href="#fn6" class="fnnum">6</a> and full command of the Illyrian <a name="fnm7" id="fnm7"></a>Sea.<a href="#fn7" class="fnnum">7</a>
Besides, what good to us are the ramparts of the mountains? Why
should we drag on the war into another summer? Where can we get
funds and supplies in the meanwhile? No, let us seize our
opportunity. The Pannonian legions are <a name="page11" id="page11" ></a><span class="pagenum">11</span>burning to rise in revenge.
They were not defeated but <a name="fnm8" id="fnm8"></a>deceived.<a href="#fn8" class="fnnum">8</a> The Moesian army has not yet
lost a man. If you count not legions but men, our forces are
superior both in numbers and in character. The very shame of our
<a name="fnm9" id="fnm9"></a>defeat<a href="#fn9" class="fnnum">9</a> makes for good discipline. And even then our cavalry was
not beaten. For though we lost the day, they shattered the enemy's
line.<a name="fnm10" id="fnm10"></a><a href="#fn10" class="fnnum">10</a> And what was the force that broke through the Vitellians?
Two regiments of cavalry from Pannonia and Moesia. What have we now?
Sixteen regiments. Will not their combined forces, as they roar and
thunder down upon the enemy, burying them in clouds of dust,
overwhelm these horses and horsemen that have forgotten how to
fight? I have given you my plan, and, unless I am stopped, I will
put it in operation. Some of you have not yet burnt your <a name="fnm11" id="fnm11"></a>boats.<a href="#fn11" class="fnnum">11</a>
Well, you can keep back the legions. Give me the auxiliaries in
light marching order. They will be enough for me. You will soon hear
that the door of Italy is open and the power of Vitellius shaken.
You will be glad enough to follow in the footsteps of my victory.'</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap3" id="IIIchap3"></a><span class="chapnum">3</span>All this and much else of the same tenor Antonius poured out
with flashing eyes, raising his voice so as to reach the centurions
and some of the soldiers, who had gathered round to share in their
deliberations.<a name="fnm12" id="fnm12"></a><a href="#fn12" class="fnnum">12</a> His truculent tone carried away even the more
cautious <a name="page12" id="page12" ></a><span class="pagenum">12</span>and far-seeing, while the rest of the crowd were filled
with contempt for the cowardice of the other generals, and cheered
their one and only leader to the echo. He had already established
his reputation at the original meeting, when Vespasian's <a name="fnm13" id="fnm13"></a>letter<a href="#fn13" class="fnnum">13</a>
was read. Most of the generals had then taken an ambiguous line,
intending to interpret their language in the light of subsequent
events. But Antonius seemed to have taken the field without any
disguise, and this carried more weight with the men, who saw that he
must share their disgrace or their glory.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap4" id="IIIchap4"></a><span class="chapnum">4</span>Next to Antonius in influence stood Cornelius Fuscus, the
imperial <a name="fnm14" id="fnm14"></a>agent.<a href="#fn14" class="fnnum">14</a> He, too, always attacked Vitellius in no mild
terms, and had left himself no hope in case of failure. Tampius
<a name="fnm15" id="fnm15"></a>Flavianus<a href="#fn15" class="fnnum">15</a> was a man whose disposition and advanced years
inclined him to dilatory measures, and he soon began to earn the
dislike and suspicion of the soldiers, who felt he had not forgotten
his kinship with Vitellius. Besides this, when the legions first
rose, he had fled to Italy and subsequently returned of his own free
will, which looked like meditating <a name="fnm16" id="fnm16"></a>treachery.<a href="#fn16" class="fnnum">16</a> Having once given
up his province and returned to Italy, he was out of the reach of
danger, but the passion for revolution had induced him to resume his
title and meddle in the civil war. It was Cornelius Fuscus who had
persuaded him to <a name="page13" id="page13" ></a><span class="pagenum">13</span>this&mdash;not that he needed his assistance, but
because he felt that, especially at the outset of the rising, the
prestige of an ex-consul would be a valuable asset to the party.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap5" id="IIIchap5"></a><span class="chapnum">5</span>In order to make their march across into Italy safe and
effective, letters were sent to Aponius <a name="fnm17" id="fnm17"></a>Saturninus<a href="#fn17" class="fnnum">17</a> to bring the
Moesian army up as quickly as possible. To prevent the exposure of
the defenceless provinces to the attacks of foreign tribes, the
chiefs of the Sarmatian <a name="fnm18" id="fnm18"></a>Iazyges,<a href="#fn18" class="fnnum">18</a> who formed the government of
the tribe, were enlisted in the service. They also offered their
tribal force, consisting entirely of cavalry, but were excused from
this contribution for fear that the civil war might give opportunity
for a foreign invasion, or that an offer of higher pay from the
enemy might tempt them to sacrifice their duty and their <a name="fnm19" id="fnm19"></a>honour.<a href="#fn19" class="fnnum">19</a>
Sido and Italicus, two princes of the <a name="fnm20" id="fnm20"></a>Suebi,<a href="#fn20" class="fnnum">20</a> were allowed to
join Vespasian's side. They had long acknowledged Roman sovereignty,
and companionship in <a name="fnm21" id="fnm21"></a>arms<a href="#fn21" class="fnnum">21</a> was likely to strengthen the loyalty
of the tribe. Some auxiliaries were stationed on the flank towards
Raetia, where hostilities were expected, since <a name="page14" id="page14" ></a><span class="pagenum">14</span>the imperial agent
Porcius <a name="fnm22" id="fnm22"></a>Septiminus,<a href="#fn22" class="fnnum">22</a> remained incorruptibly loyal to Vitellius.
Sextilius Felix was therefore dispatched with Aurius' <a name="fnm23" id="fnm23"></a>Horse<a href="#fn23" class="fnnum">23</a> and
eight cohorts of auxiliary infantry, together with the native levies
of Noricum, to hold the line of the river <a name="fnm24" id="fnm24"></a>Aenus,<a href="#fn24" class="fnnum">24</a> which forms the
frontier of Raetia and Noricum. Neither side provoked a battle: the
fortune of the rival parties was decided elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap6" id="IIIchap6"></a><span class="chapnum">6</span>Meanwhile, at the head of a picked band of auxiliaries and
part of the cavalry, Antonius hurried off to invade Italy. He took
with him an energetic soldier named Arrius Varus, who had made his
reputation while serving under Corbulo in his Armenian victories. He
was supposed to have sought a private interview with Nero, at which
he maligned Corbulo's character. His infamous treachery brought him
the emperor's favour and a post as senior centurion. This ill-gotten
prize delighted him now, but ultimately proved his <a name="fnm25" id="fnm25"></a>ruin.<a href="#fn25" class="fnnum">25</a></p>

<p>After occupying <a name="fnm26" id="fnm26"></a>Aquileia,<a href="#fn26" class="fnnum">26</a> Antonius and Varus found a ready
welcome at Opitergium and <a name="fnm27" id="fnm27"></a>Altinum<a href="#fn27" class="fnnum">27</a> and all the other towns in the
neighbourhood. At Altinum a garrison was left behind to guard their
communications against the fleet at Ravenna, for the news of its
desertion had not as yet arrived. Pressing forward, they won
Patavium and <a name="fnm28" id="fnm28"></a>Ateste<a href="#fn28" class="fnnum">28</a> for the party.<a name="page15" id="page15" ></a><span class="pagenum">15</span> At the latter place they
learnt that three cohorts of Vitellius' auxiliary infantry and a
regiment of cavalry, known as Sebosus' <a name="fnm29" id="fnm29"></a>Horse,<a href="#fn29" class="fnnum">29</a> were established
at Forum <a name="fnm30" id="fnm30"></a>Alieni,<a href="#fn30" class="fnnum">30</a> where they had constructed a <a name="fnm31" id="fnm31"></a>bridge.<a href="#fn31" class="fnnum">31</a> The
report added that they were off their guard, so this seemed a good
opportunity to attack them. They accordingly rushed the position at
dawn, and cut down many of the men without their weapons. Orders had
been given that, after a few had been killed, the rest should be
terrorized into desertion. Some surrendered at once, but the
majority succeeded in destroying the bridge, and thus checked the
enemy's pursuit. The first bout had gone in the Flavians' favour.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap7" id="IIIchap7"></a><span class="chapnum">7</span>When the news spread to Poetovio, the Seventh Galbian and
the Thirteenth Gemina hurried in high spirits to Patavium under the
command of Vedius Aquila. At Patavium they were given a few days'
rest, during which Minicius Justus, the camp-prefect of the Seventh
legion, who endeavoured to enforce a standard of discipline too
severe for civil war, had to be rescued from the fury of his troops
and sent to Vespasian. Antonius conceived that his party would gain
in prestige, if they showed approval of Galba's government, and
stood for the revival of his cause. So he gave orders that all the
statues of Galba, which had been thrown down during the civil war,
should be replaced for worship throughout the country towns.<a name="page16" id="page16" ></a><span class="pagenum">16</span> This
was a thing that had long been desired, and in their ambitious
imaginations it assumed an undue importance.</p>


<p><a name="IIIchap8" id="IIIchap8"></a><span class="chapnum">8</span>The question then arose where they should choose their seat
of war. The best place seemed to be Verona. The open country round
it was suited for the man&oelig;uvres of the cavalry, in which their
strength lay: and they would gain both prestige and profit by
wresting from Vitellius a strongly garrisoned town. On the road they
occupied <a name="fnm32" id="fnm32"></a>Vicetia.<a href="#fn32" class="fnnum">32</a> In itself this was a very small matter, since
there was only a moderate force in the town, but it gained
considerable importance from the reflection that it was Caecina's
birthplace: the enemy's general had thus lost his native town. But
Verona was well worth while. The inhabitants could aid the party
with encouragement and funds: the army was thrust midway between
Raetia and the Julian <a name="fnm33" id="fnm33"></a>Alps,<a href="#fn33" class="fnnum">33</a> and had thus blocked all passages by
that route for the German armies.</p>

<p>This move had been made either without the knowledge or against the
orders of Vespasian. His instructions were to suspend operations at
Aquileia and wait for the arrival of Mucianus. He had further added
this consideration, that so long as he held Egypt and the key to the
corn-supply,<a name="fnm34" id="fnm34"></a><a href="#fn34" class="fnnum">34</a> as well as the revenue of the richest
provinces,<a name="fnm35" id="fnm35"></a><a href="#fn35" class="fnnum">35</a> he could reduce Vitellius' army to submission from
sheer lack of money and provisions. Mucianus had sent letter after
letter <a name="page17" id="page17" ></a><span class="pagenum">17</span>with the same advice, pointing to the prospect of a victory
without bloodshed or bereavement, and using other similar pretexts
to conceal his real motive. This was ambition. He wanted to keep all
the glory of the war to himself. However, the distance was so great
that events outran his instructions.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap9" id="IIIchap9"></a><span class="chapnum">9</span>Antonius accordingly made a sudden sally against the enemy's
outposts, and after a slight skirmish, in which they tested each
other's temper, both sides withdrew without advantage. Soon after,
Caecina entrenched a strong position between a Veronese village
called <a name="fnm36" id="fnm36"></a>Hostilia<a href="#fn36" class="fnnum">36</a> and the marshes of the river Tartaro. Here he
was safe, with the river in his rear and the marsh to guard his
flanks. Had he added loyalty to his other advantages, he might have
employed the full strength of the Vitellian forces to crush the
enemy's two legions, before they were reinforced by the Moesian
army, or, at least, have forced them to retire in ignominious flight
and abandon Italy. But Caecina used various pretexts for delay, and
at the outset of the war treacherously yielded all his advantages to
the enemy. While it was open to him to rout them by force of arms,
he preferred to pester them with letters and to wait until his
intermediaries had settled the terms of his treason. In the
meantime, Aponius Saturninus arrived with the Seventh Claudian
legion,<a name="fnm37" id="fnm37"></a><a href="#fn37" class="fnnum">37</a> commanded by the <a name="fnm38" id="fnm38"></a>tribune<a href="#fn38" class="fnnum">38</a> Vipstanus Messala, a
distinguished member <a name="page18" id="page18" ></a><span class="pagenum">18</span>of a famous family, and the only man who
brought any honesty to this <a name="fnm39" id="fnm39"></a>war.<a href="#fn39" class="fnnum">39</a> To these forces, still only
three legions and no match for the Vitellians, Caecina addressed his
letters. He criticized their rash attempt to sustain a lost cause,
and at the same time praised the courage of the German army in the
highest terms. His allusions to Vitellius were few and casual, and
he refrained from insulting Vespasian. In fact he used no language
calculated either to seduce or to terrorize the enemy. The Flavian
generals made no attempt to explain away their former defeat. They
proudly championed Vespasian, showing their loyalty to the cause,
their confidence in the army, and their hostile <a name="fnm40" id="fnm40"></a>prejudice<a href="#fn40" class="fnnum">40</a>
against Vitellius. To the tribunes and centurions they held out the
hope of retaining all the favours they had won from Vitellius, and
they urged Caecina himself in plain terms to desert. These letters
<a name="page19" id="page19" ></a><span class="pagenum">19</span>were both read before a meeting of the Flavian army, and served to
increase their confidence, for while Caecina wrote mildly and seemed
afraid of offending Vespasian, their own generals had answered
contemptuously and scoffed at Vitellius.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap10" id="IIIchap10"></a><span class="chapnum">10</span>When the two other legions arrived, the <a name="fnm41" id="fnm41"></a>Third<a href="#fn41" class="fnnum">41</a> commanded
by Dillius Aponianus, and the Eighth by Numisius Lupus, Antonius
decided to entrench Verona and make a demonstration in force. It so
happened that the Galbian legion, who had been told off to work in
the trenches facing the enemy, catching sight of some of their
allies' cavalry in the distance, took them for the enemy, and fell
into a groundless panic. Suspecting treachery, they seized their
arms and visited their fury on Tampius <a name="fnm42" id="fnm42"></a>Flavianus.<a href="#fn42" class="fnnum">42</a> They could
prove no charge against him, but he had long been unpopular, and a
blind impulse made them clamour for his head. He was Vitellius'
kinsman, they howled; he had betrayed Otho; he had embezzled their
donative. They would listen to no defence, although he implored them
with outstretched hands, grovelling for the most part flat upon the
ground, his clothes all torn, his face and chest shaken with sobs.
This only served to inflame the soldiers' anger. His very excess of
terror seemed to prove his guilt. <a name="fnm43" id="fnm43"></a>Aponius<a href="#fn43" class="fnnum">43</a> tried to address them,
but his voice was drowned in their shouts. The others, too, were
contemptuously howled down. They would give no one a hearing except
Antonius, who had the power of <a name="page20" id="page20" ></a><span class="pagenum">20</span>authority as well as the arts of
eloquence necessary to quiet a mob. When the riot grew worse, and
they began to pass from insulting speeches to murderous violence, he
gave orders that Flavianus should be put in chains. Feeling that
this was a <a name="fnm44" id="fnm44"></a>farce,<a href="#fn44" class="fnnum">44</a> the soldiers broke through the guards round
the general's quarters, prepared to resort to extremities. Whereupon
Antonius, drawing his sword, bared his breast and vowed that he
would die either by their hands or his own. Whenever he saw a
soldier whom he knew or could recognize by his decorations, he
called on him by name to come to the rescue. At last he turned
towards the standards and the gods of <a name="fnm45" id="fnm45"></a>war,<a href="#fn45" class="fnnum">45</a> and prayed
incessantly that they would rather inspire the enemy's army with
this mad spirit of mutiny. At last the riot died away and at
nightfall they all dispersed to their tents. Flavianus left that
same night, and on his way met letters from Vespasian, which
delivered him from danger.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap11" id="IIIchap11"></a><span class="chapnum">11</span>The infection seemed to spread among the legions. They next
attacked Aponius Saturninus, who was in command of the Moesian army.
This fresh disturbance was caused by the circulation of a letter,
which Saturninus was supposed to have written to Vitellius, and it
was the more alarming since it broke out not when they were tired by
their labours but in the <a name="page21" id="page21" ></a><span class="pagenum">21</span>middle of the day. Once the soldiers had
vied with each other in courage and discipline: now they were rivals
in ribaldry and riot. They were determined that the fury with which
they denounced Aponius should not fall short of their outcry against
Flavianus. The Moesian legions remembered that they had helped the
Pannonian army to take their revenge; while the Pannonian troops,
feeling that their comrades' mutiny acquitted them of blame, were
glad enough to repeat the crime. They invaded the country house in
which Saturninus was living. He escaped, however, aided not so much
by the efforts of Antonius, Aponianus, and Messala, who did
everything in their power to rescue him, but rather by the security
of his hiding-place, for he concealed himself in the furnace of some
disused baths. Eventually he gave up his lictors and retired to
Patavium. The departure of both the consular governors left Antonius
in supreme command of the two armies. His <a name="fnm46" id="fnm46"></a>colleagues<a href="#fn46" class="fnnum">46</a> deferred to
him and the men gave him enthusiastic support. It was even supposed
by some that he had cunningly promoted both outbreaks, to secure for
himself the full profit of the war.</p>

<h3><a name="Dissension" id="Dissension"></a>Dissension in Vitellius' Camp</h3>

<p><a name="IIIchap12" id="IIIchap12"></a><span class="chapnum">12</span><a name="fnm47" id="fnm47"></a><a href="#fn47" class="fnnum">47</a>Vitellius' party was equally a prey to disquiet, and
there the dissension was the more fatal, since it was aroused not by
the men's suspicions but by the <a name="page22" id="page22" ></a><span class="pagenum">22</span>treachery of the generals. The
sailors of the fleet at Ravenna were mostly drawn from the provinces
of Dalmatia and Pannonia, which were both held for Vespasian, and
while they were still wavering, the admiral, Lucilius Bassus,
decided them in favour of the Flavian party. Choosing the night-time
for their treason, the conspirators assembled at head-quarters
without the knowledge of the other sailors. Bassus, who was either
ashamed or uncertain of their success, awaited developments in his
house. Amid great disturbance the ships' captains attacked the
images of Vitellius and cut down the few men who offered any
resistance. The rest of the fleet were glad enough of a change, and
their sympathies soon came round to Vespasian. Then Lucilius
appeared and publicly claimed responsibility. The fleet appointed
Cornelius <a name="fnm48" id="fnm48"></a>Fuscus<a href="#fn48" class="fnnum">48</a> as their admiral, and he came hurrying on to
the scene. Bassus was put under honourable arrest and conveyed with
an escort of Liburnian <a name="fnm49" id="fnm49"></a>cruisers<a href="#fn49" class="fnnum">49</a> to <a name="fnm50" id="fnm50"></a>Atria,<a href="#fn50" class="fnnum">50</a> where he was
imprisoned by Vibennius Rufinus, who commanded a regiment of
auxiliary horse in garrison there. However, he was soon set free on
the intervention of Hormus, one of the emperor's freedmen. For he,
too, ranked as a general.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap13" id="IIIchap13"></a><span class="chapnum">13</span>When the news that the navy had gone over became known,
Caecina, carefully selecting a moment when the camp was deserted,
and the men had all gone to their various duties, summoned to
head-quarters the senior centurions and a few of the soldiers. He
then proceeded <a name="page23" id="page23" ></a><span class="pagenum">23</span>to praise the spirit and the strength of Vespasian's
party: 'they themselves had been deserted by the fleet; they were
cramped for supplies; Spain and Gaul were against them; Rome could
not be trusted.' In every way he exaggerated the weakness of
Vitellius' position. Eventually, when some of his accomplices had
given the cue and the rest were dumbfoundered by his change of
front, he made them all swear allegiance to Vespasian. Immediately
the <a name="fnm51" id="fnm51"></a>portraits<a href="#fn51" class="fnnum">51</a> of Vitellius were torn down and messengers
dispatched to Antonius. However, when the treason got abroad in the
camp, and the men returning to head-quarters saw Vespasian's name on
the standards and Vitellius' portraits scattered on the ground, at
first there was an ominous silence: then with one voice they all
vented their feelings. Had the pride of the German army sunk so low
that without a battle and without a blow they should let their hands
be shackled and render up their arms? What had they against them?
None but defeated troops. The only sound legions of Otho's army, the
First and the Fourteenth, Vespasian had not got, and even those they
had routed and cut to pieces on that same field. And all for what?
That these thousands of fighting men should be handed over like a
drove of slaves to Antonius, the convict!<a name="fnm52" id="fnm52"></a><a href="#fn52" class="fnnum">52</a> 'Eight legions,
forsooth, are to follow the lead of one miserable fleet. Such is the
pleasure of Bassus and Caecina. They have robbed the emperor of his
home, his estate, and all his wealth, and now they want to take away
his troops.<a name="page24" id="page24" ></a><span class="pagenum">24</span> We have never lost a man nor shed a drop of blood. The
very Flavians will despise us. What answer can we give when they
question us about our victory or our defeat?'</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap14" id="IIIchap14"></a><span class="chapnum">14</span>Thus they shouted one and all as their indignation urged
them. Led by the Fifth legion, they replaced the portraits of
Vitellius and put Caecina in irons. They selected Fabius Fabullus,
commanding the Fifth legion, and the camp-prefect, Cassius Longus,
to lead them. Some marines who arrived at this point from three
Liburnian <a name="fnm53" id="fnm53"></a>cruisers,<a href="#fn53" class="fnnum">53</a> quite innocent and unaware of what had
happened, were promptly butchered. Then the men deserted their camp,
broke down the <a name="fnm54" id="fnm54"></a>bridge,<a href="#fn54" class="fnnum">54</a> and marched back to Hostilia, and thence
to Cremona to join the two legions, the First Italian and
Twenty-first Rapax, which Caecina had sent <a name="fnm55" id="fnm55"></a>ahead<a href="#fn55" class="fnnum">55</a> with some of
the cavalry to occupy Cremona.</p>

<h3><a name="The_Engagement" id="The_Engagement"></a>The Engagement near Cremona</h3>

<p><a name="IIIchap15" id="IIIchap15"></a><span class="chapnum">15</span>When Antonius heard of this he determined to attack the
enemy while they were still at variance and their forces divided.
The Vitellian generals would soon recover their authority and the
troops their discipline, and confidence would come if the two
divisions were allowed to join. He guessed also that Fabius Valens
had already started from Rome and would hasten his march when he
heard of Caecina's <a name="page25" id="page25" ></a><span class="pagenum">25</span>treachery. Valens was loyal to Vitellius and an
experienced soldier. There was good reason, besides, to fear an
attack on the side of Raetia from an immense force of German
irregulars. Vitellius had already summoned auxiliaries from Britain,
Gaul, and Spain in sufficient numbers to blight their chances
utterly, had not Antonius in fear of this very prospect forestalled
the victory by hurriedly forcing an engagement. In two days he
marched his whole force from Verona to <a name="fnm56" id="fnm56"></a>Bedriacum.<a href="#fn56" class="fnnum">56</a> On the next
<a name="fnm57" id="fnm57"></a>day<a href="#fn57" class="fnnum">57</a> he left his legions behind to fortify the camp, and sent out
his auxiliary infantry into territory belonging to Cremona, to taste
the joys of plundering their compatriots under pretext of collecting
supplies. To secure greater freedom for their depredations, he
himself advanced at the head of four thousand cavalry eight miles
along the road from Bedriacum. The scouts, as is usual, turned their
attention further afield.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap16" id="IIIchap16"></a><span class="chapnum">16</span>About eleven in the morning a mounted scout galloped up
with the news that the enemy were at hand; there was a small body in
advance of the rest, but the noise of an army in movement could be
heard over the country-side. While Antonius was debating what he
ought to do, Arrius Varus, who was greedy to distinguish himself,
galloped out with the keenest of the troopers and charged the
Vitellians, inflicting only slight loss; for, on the arrival of
reinforcements, the tables were turned and those who had been
hottest in pursuit were now hindmost in the rout. Their <a name="page26" id="page26" ></a><span class="pagenum">26</span>haste had
no sanction from Antonius, who had foreseen what would happen.
Encouraging his men to engage with brave hearts, he drew off the
cavalry on to each flank and left a free passage in the centre to
receive Varus and his troopers. Orders were sent to the legions to
arm and signals were displayed to the foraging party, summoning them
to cease plundering and join the battle by the quickest possible
path. Meanwhile Varus came plunging in terror into the middle of
their ranks, spreading confusion among them. The fresh troops were
swept back along with the wounded, themselves sharing the panic and
sorely embarrassed by the narrowness of the road.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap17" id="IIIchap17"></a><span class="chapnum">17</span>In all the confusion of the rout Antonius never for a
moment forgot what befitted a determined general and a brave
soldier. Staying the panic-stricken, checking the fugitives,
wherever the fight was thickest, wherever he saw a gleam of hope, he
schemed, he fought, he shouted, always conspicuous to his own men
and a mark for the enemy. At last, in the heat of his impatience, he
thrust through with a lance a standard-bearer, who was in full
flight, then seized the standard and turned it against the enemy.
Whereupon for very shame a few of his troopers, not more than a
hundred, made a stand. The nature of the ground helped them. The
road there was narrower; a stream barred their way, and the bridge
was broken; its depth was uncertain and the steep banks checked
their flight. Thus necessity or chance restored their fallen
fortunes. Forming in close order, they received <a name="page27" id="page27" ></a><span class="pagenum">27</span>the Vitellians'
reckless and disordered charge, and at once flung them into
confusion. Antonius pressed hard on the fugitives and cut down all
who blocked his path. The others followed each his inclination,
rifling the dead, capturing prisoners, seizing arms and horses.
Meanwhile, summoned by their shouts of triumph, those who had just
now been in full flight across the fields came hurrying back to
share the victory.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap18" id="IIIchap18"></a><span class="chapnum">18</span>Four miles from Cremona they saw the standards of the Rapax
and Italian legions gleaming in the sun. They had marched out thus
far under cover of their cavalry's original success. When fortune
turned against them, they neither opened their ranks to receive the
routed troops nor marched out to attack the enemy, who were wearied
with fighting and their long pursuit. While all went well the
Vitellians did not miss their general, but in the hour of danger
they realized their loss. The victorious cavalry came charging into
their wavering line, and at the same time Vipstanus Messala arrived
with the Moesian auxiliaries and a good number of men from the
legions, who had kept up with the pace of their forced <a name="fnm58" id="fnm58"></a>march.<a href="#fn58" class="fnnum">58</a>
These combined forces broke the opposing column, and the proximity
of Cremona's sheltering walls gave the Vitellians more hope of
refuge and less stomach for resistance.</p>

<h3><a name="The_Fate" id="The_Fate"></a>The Fate of Cremona</h3>

<p>Antonius did not follow up his advantage. He realized that, although
the issue had been successful, the battle had long been doubtful,
and had cost the troopers and their horses many wounds and much hard
fighting. <a name="IIIchap19" id="IIIchap19"></a><span class="chapnum">19</span>As evening fell, the whole strength of the
Flavian army arrived. They had marched among heaps of corpses, and
the still reeking traces of slaughter, and now, feeling that the war
was over, they clamoured to advance at once on Cremona and either
receive its submission or take it by storm. This sounded well for
public utterance, but each man in his heart was thinking, 'We could
easily rush a city on the plain. In a night-assault men are just as
brave and have a better chance of plunder. If we wait for day it
will be all peace and petitions, and what shall we get for our
wounds and our labours? A reputation for mercy! There's no money in
that. All the wealth of Cremona will find its way into the officers'
pockets. Storm a city, and the plunder goes to the soldiers: if it
surrenders, the generals get it.' They refused to listen to their
centurions and tribunes and drowned their voices in a rattle of
arms, swearing they would break their orders unless they were led
out. <a name="IIIchap20" id="IIIchap20"></a><span class="chapnum">20</span>Antonius then went round among the companies, where
his authoritative bearing obtained silence. He assured them that he
had no wish to rob them of the glory and the reward they so well
deserved. 'But,' he said, 'an army and a general have different
functions. It is right that soldiers <a name="page29" id="page29" ></a><span class="pagenum">29</span>should be greedy for battle,
but the general often does more good not by temerity but by
foresight, deliberation and delay. I have done all I could to aid
your victory with my sword: now I will serve you by the general's
proper arts of calculation and strategy. The risks that face us are
obvious. It is night; we know nothing of the lie of the city; the
enemy are behind the walls; everything favours an ambush. Even if
the gates were open, we cannot safely enter except by day and after
due reconnoitring. Are you going to begin storming the town when you
cannot possibly see where the ground is level and how high the walls
are? How do you know whether to assault it with engines and showers
of missiles, or with penthouses and shelters?'<a name="fnm59" id="fnm59"></a><a href="#fn59" class="fnnum">59</a> Then he turned to
individuals, asking one after another whether they had brought
hatchets and pick-axes and other implements for storming a town.
When they answered no, 'Well,' he said, 'could any troops possibly
break through walls or undermine them with nothing but swords and
javelins? Suppose it proves necessary to construct a mound and to
shelter ourselves with mantlets and fascines,<a href="#fn59" class="fnnum">59</a> are we going to
stand idle like a lot of helpless idiots, gaping at the height of
the enemy's towers and ramparts? Why not rather wait one night till
our siege-train arrives and then carry the victory by force?' So
saying, he sent the camp-followers and servants with the freshest of
the troopers back to Bedriacum to bring up supplies and whatever
else was wanted.</p>

<p><a name="page30" id="page30" ></a><span class="pagenum">30</span><a name="IIIchap21" id="IIIchap21"></a><span class="chapnum">21</span>The soldiers indeed chafed at this and mutiny seemed
imminent, when some of the mounted scouts, who had ridden right up
to the walls, captured a few stragglers from Cremona, and learnt
from them that six Vitellian legions and the whole Hostilia army had
that very day covered thirty miles, and, hearing of their comrades'
defeat, were already arming for battle and would be on them
immediately. This alarming news cured their obstinate deafness to
the general's advice. He ordered the Thirteenth legion to take up
their position on the raised Postumian high-road. In touch with them
on the left wing in the open country were the Seventh Galbian,
beside whom stood the Seventh Claudian, so placed that their front
was protected by a ditch. On the right wing were the Eighth, drawn
up along an open cross-road, and next to them the Third, distributed
among some thick clumps of trees. Such, at any rate, was the order
of the eagles and standards. In the darkness the soldiers were
confused and took their places at random. The band of <a name="fnm60" id="fnm60"></a>Guards<a href="#fn60" class="fnnum">60</a> was
next to the Third, and the auxiliaries on the wings, while the
cavalry were disposed in support round the flanks and the rear. Sido
and Italicus with their picked band of <a name="fnm61" id="fnm61"></a>Suebi<a href="#fn61" class="fnnum">61</a> fought in the front
line.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap22" id="IIIchap22"></a><span class="chapnum">22</span>For the Vitellians the right course was to rest at Cremona
and recuperate their strength with food and a night's rest, and then
on the next day to crush and <a name="page31" id="page31" ></a><span class="pagenum">31</span>rout the Flavians when they were stiff
with cold and weak from hunger. But they had no general;<a name="fnm62" id="fnm62"></a><a href="#fn62" class="fnnum">62</a> they
had no plan. Though it was nearly nine at night they flung
themselves upon the Flavians, who were standing steady in their
places to receive them. In their fury and the darkness the Vitellian
line was so disordered that one can hardly venture to describe the
disposition of their troops. However, it has been stated that the
Fourth Macedonian legion were on the right flank; in the centre were
the Fifth and Fifteenth with the detachments of the Ninth, the
Second and the Twentieth from Britain; the Sixteenth, the
Twenty-second, and the First formed the left wing. The men of the
Rapax and Italian <a name="fnm63" id="fnm63"></a>legions<a href="#fn63" class="fnnum">63</a> were distributed among all the
companies.<a name="fnm64" id="fnm64"></a><a href="#fn64" class="fnnum">64</a> The cavalry and auxiliaries picked their own
position. All night the battle raged with varying fortune, never
decided, always savagely contested. Disaster threatened now one
side, now the other. Courage, strength were of little use: their
eyes could not even see in front of them. Both sides were armed
alike; the watchwords, constantly demanded, soon became known; the
standards were all in confusion, as they were captured and carried
off from one band to another. The Seventh legion, raised recently by
Galba, suffered most severely. Six of the senior centurions fell and
several <a name="page32" id="page32" ></a><span class="pagenum">32</span>standards were lost. They nearly lost their eagle too, but
it was rescued by the bravery of the senior centurion, named Atilius
Verus, who after great slaughter of the enemy fell finally himself.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap23" id="IIIchap23"></a><span class="chapnum">23</span>Antonius had meanwhile called up the Guards to reinforce
his wavering line. Taking up the fight, they repulsed the enemy,
only to be repulsed in their turn. For the Vitellian artillery,
which had at first been scattered all along the line, and had been
discharged upon the bushes without hurting the enemy, was now massed
upon the high-road, and swept the open space in front. One immense
engine in particular, which belonged to the Fifteenth, mowed down
the Flavian line with huge stones. The slaughter thus caused would
have been enormous, had not two of the Flavian soldiers performed a
memorable exploit. Concealing their identity by snatching up shields
from among the enemy's <a name="fnm65" id="fnm65"></a>dead,<a href="#fn65" class="fnnum">65</a> they cut the ropes which suspended
the weights of the engine. They fell immediately, riddled with
wounds, and so their names have perished. But of their deed there is
no doubt.</p>

<p>Fortune had favoured neither side when, as the night wore on, the
moon rose and threw a deceptive glamour over the field of battle.
Shining from behind the Flavians the moon was in their favour. It
magnified the shadows of their men and horses so that the enemy took
the shadow for the substance, and their <a name="page33" id="page33" ></a><span class="pagenum">33</span>missiles were misdirected
and fell short. The Vitellians, on the other hand, had the moon
shining full on them and were an easy mark for the Flavians,
shooting as it were out of <a name="fnm66" id="fnm66"></a>cover.<a href="#fn66" class="fnnum">66</a></p>

<p><a name="IIIchap24" id="IIIchap24"></a><span class="chapnum">24</span>Thus being enabled to recognize his own men, and to be
recognized by them, Antonius appealed to some by taunting their
honour, to many by words of praise and encouragement, to all by
promising hope of reward. He asked the Pannonian legions why they
had drawn their swords again. Here on this field they could regain
their glory and wipe out the stain of their former <a name="fnm67" id="fnm67"></a>disgrace.<a href="#fn67" class="fnnum">67</a>
Then turning to the Moesian troops, who were the chief promoters of
the <a name="fnm68" id="fnm68"></a>war,<a href="#fn68" class="fnnum">68</a> he told them it was no good challenging the Vitellians
with verbal threats, if they could not bear to face them and their
blows. Thus he addressed each legion as he reached it. To the Third
he spoke at greater length, reminding them of their victories both
old and new. Had they not under Mark Antony defeated the
<a name="fnm69" id="fnm69"></a>Parthians<a href="#fn69" class="fnnum">69</a> and the Armenians under <a name="fnm70" id="fnm70"></a>Corbulo?<a href="#fn70" class="fnnum">70</a> Had they not but
lately crushed the <a name="fnm71" id="fnm71"></a>Sarmatians?<a href="#fn71" class="fnnum">71</a> Then he turned in fury on the
Guards. 'Peasants that you are,' he shouted, 'have you another
emperor, another camp waiting to shelter you, if you are defeated?
There in the enemy's line are your standards <a name="page34" id="page34" ></a><span class="pagenum">34</span>and your arms: defeat
means death and&mdash;no, you have drained disgrace already to the
dregs.'</p>

<p>These words roused cheers on all sides, and the Third, following the
Syrian <a name="fnm72" id="fnm72"></a>custom,<a href="#fn72" class="fnnum">72</a> saluted the rising sun. <a name="IIIchap25" id="IIIchap25"></a><span class="chapnum">25</span>Thus arose a
casual rumour&mdash;or possibly it was suggested by the general's
ingenuity&mdash;that Mucianus had arrived, and that the two armies were
cheering each other. On they pressed, feeling they had been
reinforced. The Vitellian line was more ragged now, for, having no
general to marshal them, their ranks now filled, now thinned, with
each alternation of courage and fear. As soon as Antonius saw them
waver, he kept thrusting at them in massed column. The line bent and
then broke, and the inextricable confusion of wagons and
siege-engines prevented their rallying. The victorious troops
scattered along the cross-road in headlong pursuit.</p>

<p>The slaughter was marked by one peculiar horror. A son killed his
father. I give the facts and names on the authority of Vipstanus
Messala.<a name="fnm73" id="fnm73"></a><a href="#fn73" class="fnnum">73</a> One Julius Mansuetus, a Spaniard who had joined the
legion Rapax, had left a young son at home. This boy subsequently
grew up and enlisted in the Seventh legion, raised by <a name="fnm74" id="fnm74"></a>Galba.<a href="#fn74" class="fnnum">74</a>
Chance now sent his father in his way, and he felled him to the
ground. While he was ransacking the dying man, they recognized each
other. Flinging his arms round the now lifeless corpse, in <a name="page35" id="page35" ></a><span class="pagenum">35</span>a
piteous voice he implored his father's spirit to be appeased and not
to turn against him as a parricide. The crime was his country's, he
cried; what share had a single soldier in these civil wars?
Meanwhile he lifted the body and began to dig a grave and perform
the last rites for his father. Those who were nearest noticed this;
then the story began to spread, till there ran through the army
astonishment and many complaints and curses against this wicked war.
Yet they never ceased busily killing and plundering friends and
relatives and brothers; and while they talked of the crime they were
committing it themselves.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap26" id="IIIchap26"></a><span class="chapnum">26</span>When they reached Cremona a fresh task of vast difficulty
awaited them. During the war with <a name="fnm75" id="fnm75"></a>Otho<a href="#fn75" class="fnnum">75</a> the German army had
entrenched their camp round the walls of Cremona and then erected a
rampart round the camp; and these fortifications had been further
strengthened. The sight of them brought the victors to a halt, and
their generals were uncertain what instructions to give. The troops
had had no rest for a day and a night. To storm the town at once
would be an arduous and, in the absence of reserves, a perilous
task. On the other hand, a retreat to Bedriacum would involve the
intolerable fatigue of a long march, and destroy the value of their
victory. Again, it would be dangerous to entrench themselves so
close to the lines of the enemy, who might at any minute sally forth
and rout them while they were dispersed and digging trenches. The
chief anxiety lay in the temper <a name="page36" id="page36" ></a><span class="pagenum">36</span>of the men, who were much more
ready to face danger than delay. To them discretion was disagreeable
and hazard spelt hope. Their thirst for plunder outweighed all fears
of wounds and bloodshed.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap27" id="IIIchap27"></a><span class="chapnum">27</span>Antonius also inclined to this view and gave orders for
them to surround the rampart. At first they stood back and delivered
volleys of arrows and stones, suffering themselves the severer loss,
for a storm of missiles rained down from the walls. Antonius then
told off each legion to assault a different point of the rampart or
one of the gates, hoping that by thus separating them he could
distinguish the cowards from the brave and inflame them with a
spirit of honourable rivalry. The Third and Seventh took the
position nearest the road to Bedriacum; the Eighth and Seventh
Claudian assaulted the right-hand side of the rampart; the
Thirteenth swept up to the Brixian <a name="fnm76" id="fnm76"></a>Gate.<a href="#fn76" class="fnnum">76</a> A brief delay was
caused while some fetched mattocks and pickaxes from the fields, and
others hooks and ladders. Then holding their shields above their
heads in close 'tortoise' <a name="fnm77" id="fnm77"></a>formation,<a href="#fn77" class="fnnum">77</a> they advanced under the
rampart. Both sides employed Roman tactics. The Vitellians rolled
down huge masses of stones, and, as the sheltering cover of shields
parted and wavered, they thrust at it with lances and poles, until
at last <a name="page37" id="page37" ></a><span class="pagenum">37</span>the whole structure was broken up and they mowed down the
torn and bleeding soldiers beneath with terrible slaughter.</p>

<p>The men would certainly have hesitated, had not the generals,
realizing that they were really too tired to respond to any other
form of encouragement, pointed significantly to Cremona.
<a name="IIIchap28" id="IIIchap28"></a><span class="chapnum">28</span>Whether this was Hormus's idea, as <a name="fnm78" id="fnm78"></a>Messala<a href="#fn78" class="fnnum">78</a> records, or
whether we should rather follow Caius Pliny, who accuses Antonius,
it is not easy to determine. This one may say, that, however
abominable the crime, yet in committing it neither Antonius nor
Hormus belied the reputation of their lives. After this neither
wounds nor bloodshed could stay the Flavian troops. They demolished
the rampart, shook the gates, climbed up on each other's shoulders,
or over the re-formed 'tortoise', and snatched away the enemy's
weapons or caught hold of them by the arms. Thus the wounded and
unwounded, the half-dead and the dying, all came rolling down and
perished together by every imaginable kind of death.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap29" id="IIIchap29"></a><span class="chapnum">29</span>The fight raged thickest round the Third and Seventh
legions, and the general, Antonius, came up with a picked band of
auxiliaries to support their assault. The Vitellians, finding
themselves unable to resist the attack of troops thus stubbornly
vying with each other, and seeing their missiles all glide off the
shelter of shields, at last sent their engine of war crashing down
upon their heads. For the moment it <a name="page38" id="page38" ></a><span class="pagenum">38</span>scattered and crushed beneath
it the men on whom it fell, but it dragged with it some of the
battlements and the top of the rampart. At the same moment one of
the towers on the rampart gave way under a shower of stones. While
the men of the Seventh struggled up to the breach in close
column,<a name="fnm79" id="fnm79"></a><a href="#fn79" class="fnnum">79</a> the Third hewed down the gate with hatchets and swords.
All the <a name="fnm80" id="fnm80"></a>authorities<a href="#fn80" class="fnnum">80</a> agree that Caius Volusius of the Third
legion was the first man in. Emerging on the top of the rampart, he
hurled down those who barred his path, and from this conspicuous
position waved his hand and shouted that the camp was taken. The
others poured through, while the Vitellians in panic flung
themselves down from the rampart, and the whole space between the
camp and the walls became a seething scene of carnage.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap30" id="IIIchap30"></a><span class="chapnum">30</span>Here, again, was a new type of task for the Flavians. Here
were high walls, stone battlements, iron-barred gates, and soldiers
hurling javelins. The citizens of Cremona were numerous and devoted
to the cause of Vitellius, and half Italy had gathered there for the
Fair which fell just at that time. Their numbers were a help to the
defenders, but the prospect of plundering them offered an incentive
to their assailants. Antonius ordered his men to bring fire and
apply it to the most beautiful of the buildings outside the walls,
hoping that the loss of their property might induce the citizens to
turn traitor. The houses that stood nearest to <a name="page39" id="page39" ></a><span class="pagenum">39</span>the walls and
overtopped them he crowded with his bravest troops, who dislodged
the defenders with showers of beams and tiles and flaming torches.
<a name="IIIchap31" id="IIIchap31"></a><span class="chapnum">31</span>Meanwhile, some of the legionaries began to advance in
'tortoise' <a name="fnm81" id="fnm81"></a>formation,<a href="#fn81" class="fnnum">81</a> while others kept up a steady fire of
javelins and stones.</p>

<p>Gradually the spirit of the Vitellians ebbed. The higher their rank,
the more easily they gave way to misfortune. For they were afraid
that if Cremona <a name="fnm82" id="fnm82"></a>too<a href="#fn82" class="fnnum">82</a> was demolished, there would be no hope of
pardon; the victors' fury would fall not on the common poor but on
the tribunes and centurions, whom it would pay to kill. The common
soldiers felt safe in their obscurity, and, careless of the future,
continued to offer resistance. They roamed the streets or hid
themselves in houses, and though they had given up the war, refused
even so to sue for peace. Meanwhile the tribunes and centurions did
away with the name and portraits of <a name="fnm83" id="fnm83"></a>Vitellius.<a href="#fn83" class="fnnum">83</a> They released
Caecina, who was still in <a name="fnm84" id="fnm84"></a>irons,<a href="#fn84" class="fnnum">84</a> and begged his help in pleading
their cause. When he turned from them in haughty contempt they
besought him with tears. It was, indeed, the last of evils that all
these brave men should invoke a traitor's aid. They then hung veils
and <a name="fnm85" id="fnm85"></a>fillets<a href="#fn85" class="fnnum">85</a> out on the walls, and when Antonius had given the
order to cease <a name="page40" id="page40" ></a><span class="pagenum">40</span>firing, they carried out their standards and eagles,
followed by a miserable column of disarmed soldiers, dejectedly
hanging their heads. The victors had at first crowded round, heaping
insults on them and threatening violence, but when they found that
the vanquished had lost all their proud spirit, and turned their
cheeks with servile endurance to every indignity, they gradually
began to recollect that these were the men who had made such a
moderate use of their victory at <a name="fnm86" id="fnm86"></a>Bedriacum.<a href="#fn86" class="fnnum">86</a> But when the crowd
parted, and Caecina advanced in his consular robes, attended by his
lictors in full state, their indignation broke into flame. They
charged him with insolence and cruelty, and&mdash;so hateful is
crime&mdash;they even flung his treachery in his <a name="fnm87" id="fnm87"></a>teeth.<a href="#fn87" class="fnnum">87</a> Antonius
restrained them and sent Caecina under escort to Vespasian.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap32" id="IIIchap32"></a><span class="chapnum">32</span>Meanwhile the citizens of Cremona suffered sorely from the
violence of the troops, and only the entreaties of their generals
could withhold them from a general massacre. Antonius summoned a
mass meeting and delivered a eulogy upon his victorious army,
promising mercy to the vanquished and speaking of Cremona in
ambiguous terms. Besides their natural passion for plunder, there
was an old grudge which urged them to sack Cremona. The town was
believed to have given assistance to the Vitellian cause before this
in the war with Otho;<a name="fnm88" id="fnm88"></a><a href="#fn88" class="fnnum">88</a> and again, when the Thirteenth <a name="page41" id="page41" ></a><span class="pagenum">41</span>had been
left behind to build an <a name="fnm89" id="fnm89"></a>amphitheatre,<a href="#fn89" class="fnnum">89</a> the populace had shown its
town-bred impertinence by assailing them with insolent ridicule.
Other causes increased this bad feeling: it was here that Caecina
had given his show of gladiators:<a href="#fn89" class="fnnum">89</a> the town had become for a
second time the theatre of the war: the citizens had conveyed food
to the Vitellians during the battle: some women had been killed,
whose enthusiasm for the cause had led them to take part in the
fight. Besides all this, the Fair had filled the rich city with an
even greater display of wealth than usual. All eyes were now centred
on Antonius, whose fame and good fortune overshadowed all the other
generals. It so happened that he hurried off to the baths to wash
off the stains of blood. Finding fault with the temperature of the
water, he received the answer, 'It will not be long before it is
hot,' and this phrase was caught up. The attendant's words were
repeated, and brought all the odium on Antonius, who was thus
believed to have given the signal to set fire to Cremona, which was
already in <a name="fnm90" id="fnm90"></a>flames.<a href="#fn90" class="fnnum">90</a></p>

<p><a name="IIIchap33" id="IIIchap33"></a><span class="chapnum">33</span>Thus forty thousand soldiers burst into the town with a yet
larger crowd of servants and sutlers, even more depraved than the
soldiers in their readiness for cruelty and lust. Without any
respect for age or for <a name="page42" id="page42" ></a><span class="pagenum">42</span>authority they added rape to murder and
murder to rape. Aged men and decrepit old women, who were worthless
as booty, were hustled off to make sport for them. If some grown
girl or a handsome youth fell into their clutches, they would be
torn to pieces in the struggle for possession, while the plunderers
were left to cut each other's throats. Whoever carried off money or
any of the solid gold offerings in the temples was liable to be cut
to pieces, if he met another stronger than himself. Some, disdaining
easy finds, hunted for hidden hoards, and dug out buried treasure,
flogging and torturing the householders. They held torches in their
hands and, having once secured their prize, would fling them
wantonly into an empty house or some dismantled temple. Composed as
the army was of citizens, allies, and foreign troops, differing
widely in language and customs, the objects of the soldiers' greed
differed also. But while their views of what was right might vary,
they all agreed in thinking nothing wrong.</p>

<p>Cremona lasted them four days. While all other buildings sacred and
secular sank in the flames, only the temple of Mefitis outside the
walls was left standing, saved either by its position or the power
of the presiding <a name="fnm91" id="fnm91"></a>deity.<a href="#fn91" class="fnnum">91</a></p>

<p><a name="IIIchap34" id="IIIchap34"></a><span class="chapnum">34</span>Such was the end of Cremona two hundred and eighty-six
years after its foundation. It had been originally built in the
consulship of Tiberius Sempronius and Publius Cornelius, while
Hannibal was <a name="page43" id="page43" ></a><span class="pagenum">43</span>threatening to invade Italy, to serve as a bulwark
against the Gauls beyond the <a name="fnm92" id="fnm92"></a>Po,<a href="#fn92" class="fnnum">92</a> and to resist any other power
that might break in over the Alps. And so it grew and flourished,
aided by its large number of settlers, its conveniently situated
rivers,<a name="fnm93" id="fnm93"></a><a href="#fn93" class="fnnum">93</a> the fertility of its territory, and its connexion
through alliance and intermarriage with other communities. Foreign
invasions had left it untouched only to become the victim of civil
war. Antonius, ashamed of his crime, and realizing his growing
disfavour, proclaimed that no citizen of Cremona was to be kept as a
prisoner of war; and, indeed, the unanimous feeling in Italy against
buying such slaves had already frustrated the soldiers' hope of
profit. So they began to kill their captives, whose relatives and
friends, when this became known, covertly bought their release.
After a while, the rest of the inhabitants returned, and the squares
and temples were rebuilt by the munificence of the burghers and
under Vespasian's direct patronage.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap35" id="IIIchap35"></a><span class="chapnum">35</span>However, the soil was so foully infected by the reek of
blood that it was impossible for the Flavians to encamp for long on
the ruins of this buried city. They advanced along the road to the
third milestone, and mustered the Vitellians, still straggling and
panic-stricken, each under his own standard. The defeated legions
were then distributed through Illyricum, for the civil war was still
in progress and their fidelity <a name="page44" id="page44" ></a><span class="pagenum">44</span>could not be relied on. They then
dispatched couriers to carry the news to Britain and the Spanish
provinces. To Gaul they sent an officer named Julius Calenus, to
Germany Alpinius Montanus, who had commanded an auxiliary cohort.
Montanus was a Treviran and Calenus an Aeduan; both had fought for
Vitellius and thus served to advertise Vespasian's victory. At the
same time garrisons were sent to hold the passes of the Alps, for
fear that Germany might rise in support of Vitellius.</p>

<h3><a name="Vitellius" id="Vitellius"></a>Vitellius</h3>

<p><a name="IIIchap36" id="IIIchap36"></a><span class="chapnum">36</span>When Caecina had left <a name="fnm94" id="fnm94"></a>Rome,<a href="#fn94" class="fnnum">94</a> Vitellius, after an
interval of a few days, sent Fabius Valens hurrying to the front,
and then proceeded to drown his cares in self-indulgence. He neither
made any provision for the war, nor tried to increase the efficiency
of his troops either by haranguing or by drilling them. He did not
keep himself in the public eye, but retired into the pleasant shade
of his gardens, regarding past, present, and future with equal
indifference, like one of those listless animals which lie sluggish,
and torpid so long as you supply them with food. While he thus
loitered languid and indolent in the woods of <a name="fnm95" id="fnm95"></a>Aricia,<a href="#fn95" class="fnnum">95</a> he
received the startling news of Lucilius Bassus' treachery and the
disaffection of the fleet at <a name="fnm96" id="fnm96"></a>Ravenna.<a href="#fn96" class="fnnum">96</a> Soon afterwards he heard
with mixed feelings of distress and satisfaction that Caecina had
deserted him and had been imprisoned by the <a name="page45" id="page45" ></a><span class="pagenum">45</span>army. On his insensate
nature joy had more effect than trouble. He returned in triumph to
Rome and at a crowded meeting praised the devotion of the troops in
extravagant terms. He gave orders for the imprisonment of Publilius
Sabinus, the prefect of the Guards, on the ground of his intimacy
with Caecina, and appointed Alfenus <a name="fnm97" id="fnm97"></a>Varus<a href="#fn97" class="fnnum">97</a> in his place.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap37" id="IIIchap37"></a><span class="chapnum">37</span>He next delivered a pompous and elaborate speech in the
senate, where he was loaded with far-fetched compliments by the
members. Lucius Vitellius rose to propose a harsh sentence against
Caecina. The rest of the house inveighed with assumed indignation
against the consul who had betrayed his country, the general who had
betrayed his commander-in-chief, the friend who had betrayed his
benefactor to whom he owed all his riches and distinction. But their
protestations of sympathy with Vitellius really voiced their
personal <a name="fnm98" id="fnm98"></a>vexation.<a href="#fn98" class="fnnum">98</a> None of the speeches contained any criticism
of the Flavian generals. They threw the blame on the misguided and
impolitic action of the armies, and with cautious circumlocution
avoided all direct mention of Vespasian. Caecina's <a name="fnm99" id="fnm99"></a>consulship<a href="#fn99" class="fnnum">99</a>
had still one day to run, and Rosius Regulus actually made humble
petition for this one day's office, Vitellius' offer and his
acceptance exciting universal derision. Thus he entered and
abdicated his office on the same day, the last of October. Men who
were learned in constitutional history pointed out <a name="page46" id="page46" ></a><span class="pagenum">46</span>that no one
before had ever been elected to fill a vacancy without the passing
of a bill or some act of deprivation, although there was precedent
for the one day consulship in the case of Caninius Rebilus when
Caius Caesar was dictator and the civil war necessitated prompt
rewards.<a name="fnm100" id="fnm100"></a><a href="#fn100" class="fnnum">100</a></p>

<p><a name="IIIchap38" id="IIIchap38"></a><span class="chapnum">38</span>It was at this time that the news of the death of Junius
<a name="fnm101" id="fnm101"></a>Blaesus<a href="#fn101" class="fnnum">101</a> gave rise to much talk. I give the story as I find it.
When Vitellius was lying seriously ill at his house in the Servilian
Park, he noticed that a neighbouring mansion was brilliantly
illuminated at night. On asking the reason, he was told that Caecina
<a name="fnm102" id="fnm102"></a>Tuscus<a href="#fn102" class="fnnum">102</a> was giving a large dinner-party, at which Junius Blaesus
was the chief guest. He further received an exaggerated account of
their extravagance and dissipation. Some of his informants even made
specific charges against Tuscus and others, but especially accused
Blaesus for spending his days in revelry while <a name="page47" id="page47" ></a><span class="pagenum">47</span>his emperor lay ill.
There are people who keep a sharp eye on every sign of an emperor's
displeasure. They soon made sure that Vitellius was furious and that
Blaesus' ruin would be an easy task, so they cast Lucius Vitellius
for the part of common informer. He had a mean and jealous dislike
for Blaesus, whose spotless reputation far outshone his own, which
was tainted with every kind of infamy. Bursting into the emperor's
apartment, he caught up Vitellius' young son in his arms and fell at
his feet. When asked the reason of this excitement, he said it was
due to no anxiety for himself; all his suit and all his prayers were
for his brother and his brother's children. Their fears of Vespasian
were idle: between him and Vitellius lay all the legions of Germany,
all those brave and loyal provinces, and an immeasurable space of
land and sea. 'It is here in Rome,' he cried, 'in the bosom of our
household that we have an enemy to fear, one who boasts the Junii
and Antonii as his ancestors, one who shows himself affable and
munificent to the troops, posing as a descendant of imperial
stock.<a name="fnm103" id="fnm103"></a><a href="#fn103" class="fnnum">103</a> It is to him that Rome's attention turns, while you,
Sire, careless who is friend or foe, cherish in your bosom a rival,
who sits feasting at his table and watches his emperor in pain. You
must requite his unseasonable gaiety with a night of deadly sorrow,
in which he <a name="page48" id="page48" ></a><span class="pagenum">48</span>may both know and feel that Vitellius lives and is his
emperor, and, if anything should happen, has a son to be his heir.'</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap39" id="IIIchap39"></a><span class="chapnum">39</span>Vitellius hesitated anxiously between his criminal desires
and his fear that, if he deferred Blaesus' death, he might hasten
his own ruin, or by giving official orders for it might raise a
storm of indignation. He decided to proceed by poison. The suspicion
against him he confirmed by going to see Blaesus and showing obvious
satisfaction. Moreover, he was heard to make the savage boast that
he had, to quote his own words, 'feasted his eyes on his enemy's
deathbed.'</p>

<p>Blaesus, besides his distinguished origin and refined character, was
steadfastly loyal. Even before the decline of Vitellius' cause he
had been canvassed by Caecina and other party leaders, who were
turning against the emperor, and had met them with a persistent
refusal. He was a man of quiet and blameless life, with no ambition
for the principate or, indeed, for any sudden distinction, but he
could not escape the danger of being considered worthy of it.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap40" id="IIIchap40"></a><span class="chapnum">40</span>Meanwhile Fabius Valens, encumbered by a long train of
harlots and eunuchs, was conducting a leisurely advance, most unlike
a march to the front, when couriers arrived post-haste with the news
that Lucilius Bassus had surrendered the Ravenna <a name="fnm104" id="fnm104"></a>fleet.<a href="#fn104" class="fnnum">104</a> If he
had hurried forward on his march he might have been in time to save
Caecina's faltering loyalty, or to have joined the legions before
the critical engagement was <a name="page49" id="page49" ></a><span class="pagenum">49</span>fought. Many, indeed, advised him to
avoid Ravenna and to make his way by obscure by-roads to Hostilia or
Cremona. Others wanted him to send to Rome for the Guards and to
break through the enemy's lines with a strong force. Valens himself,
with helpless indecision, let the time for action go by while he
took advice; and then rejecting the advice he was offered, chose the
middle course, which is always the worst in a crisis, and thus
failed both in courage and in caution.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap41" id="IIIchap41"></a><span class="chapnum">41</span>He wrote to Vitellius demanding reinforcements, and there
arrived three cohorts of Guards and a regiment of cavalry from
Britain, too many to slip through unobserved and too few to force a
passage. But even in such a crisis as this Valens' reputation was as
unsavoury as ever. He was still believed to use violence in the
pursuit of illicit pleasures, and to betray the confidence of his
hosts by seducing their wives and families. He had money and
authority to help him, and the feverish impatience of one whose star
is on the wane. At last the arrival of the reinforcements revealed
the perversity of his strategy. He had too few men to assume the
offensive, even if they had been unquestionably loyal, and their
loyalty was under grave suspicion. However, their sense of decency
and respect for the general restrained them for a while, though such
ties are soon broken when troops are disinclined for danger and
indifferent to <a name="fnm105" id="fnm105"></a>disgrace.<a href="#fn105" class="fnnum">105</a> Fearing trouble, he sent the Guards
forward to<a name="page50" id="page50" ></a><span class="pagenum">50</span> <a name="fnm106" id="fnm106"></a>Ariminum<a href="#fn106" class="fnnum">106</a> with the cavalry to secure the rear.
Valens himself, with a few companions, whose loyalty had survived
misfortune, turned off into Umbria and thence to Etruria, where he
learnt the result of the battle of Cremona. Thereupon he formed a
plan, which was far from cowardly and might have had alarming
consequences, if it had succeeded. He was to seize ships and cross
to some point on the coast of Narbonnese Gaul, whence he could rouse
the provinces of Gaul and the native German tribes, and thus raise
forces for a fresh outbreak of war.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap42" id="IIIchap42"></a><span class="chapnum">42</span>Valens' departure having dispirited the troops at Ariminum,
Cornelius <a name="fnm107" id="fnm107"></a>Fuscus<a href="#fn107" class="fnnum">107</a> advanced his force and, stationing
<a name="fnm108" id="fnm108"></a>Liburnian<a href="#fn108" class="fnnum">108</a> cruisers along the adjoining coast, invested the town
by land and sea. The Flavians thus occupied the Umbrian plain and
the sea-board of Picenum; and the Apennines now divided Italy
between Vitellius and Vespasian.</p>

<p>Valens, embarking from the Bay of Pisa, was either becalmed on a
slow sea or caught by an unfavourable wind and had to put in at the
harbour of Hercules <a name="fnm109" id="fnm109"></a>Monoecus.<a href="#fn109" class="fnnum">109</a> Stationed in the neighbourhood
was Marius Maturus, the Governor of the Maritime <a name="fnm110" id="fnm110"></a>Alps,<a href="#fn110" class="fnnum">110</a> who had
remained loyal to Vitellius, and, though surrounded by enemies, had
so far been faithful to his oath of allegiance. He gave Valens a
friendly welcome and strongly advised him not to venture rashly into
Narbonnese Gaul. This alarmed<a name="page51" id="page51" ></a><span class="pagenum">51</span> Valens, who found also that his
companions' loyalty was yielding to their fears. <a name="IIIchap43" id="IIIchap43"></a><span class="chapnum">43</span>For
Valerius Paulinus, the imperial agent in the province, was an
energetic soldier who had been friendly with Vespasian in old days,
and had lately sworn all the surrounding communities to his cause.
Having summoned to his flag all the Guards discharged by
Vitellius,<a name="fnm111" id="fnm111"></a><a href="#fn111" class="fnnum">111</a> who needed no persuasion to resume the war, he was
now holding the colony of Forum <a name="fnm112" id="fnm112"></a>Julii,<a href="#fn112" class="fnnum">112</a> the key to the command
of the sea. His influence carried the more weight since Forum Julii
was his native town and, having once been an officer in the Guards,
he was respected by the men. Besides this, the inhabitants supported
their fellow citizen, and in the hope of future aggrandizement
rendered enthusiastic service to the party. When the news of these
efficient preparations, somewhat exaggerated by rumour, came to the
ears of the Vitellians, who were already in some doubt, Fabius
Valens returned to the ships with four men of the Body Guard, three
of his friends and three centurions, while Maturus and the rest
preferred to remain and swear allegiance to Vespasian. As for
Valens, though he felt safer at sea than among the cities on the
coast, he was still full of doubts for the future, since he was
certain what he had to avoid but quite uncertain whom he could
trust. Eventually a gale drove him upon the <a name="fnm113" id="fnm113"></a>Stoechades,<a href="#fn113" class="fnnum">113</a> some
islands belonging to Marseilles, and there he was overtaken by the
cruisers which Paulinus had sent in pursuit.</p>

<h3><a name="The_State" id="The_State"></a>The State of the Provinces</h3>

<p><a name="IIIchap44" id="IIIchap44"></a><span class="chapnum">44</span>With the capture of Valens the tide had now fully turned in
favour of Vespasian. The movement had been begun in Spain by the
First legion <i>Adjutrix</i>,<a name="fnm114" id="fnm114"></a><a href="#fn114" class="fnnum">114</a> whose reverence for Otho's memory made
them hate Vitellius. They carried the Tenth and the <a name="fnm115" id="fnm115"></a>Sixth<a href="#fn115" class="fnnum">115</a> with
them. The provinces of Gaul soon followed suit. Britain was bound to
his cause by the favour felt for one who had been sent there by
Claudius in command of the Second legion, and had fought with great
distinction in the war. But the adherence of the province was to
some extent opposed by the other legions, in which many of the
centurions and soldiers had been promoted by Vitellius. They were
used to their emperor and felt some doubt about the change.
<a name="IIIchap45" id="IIIchap45"></a><span class="chapnum">45</span>This quarrel between the legions and the constant rumours
of civil war, encouraged the Britons to take heart. Their chief
instigator was one Venutius. He was of a ferocious disposition and
hated the name of Rome, but his strongest motive was a private
quarrel with Queen Cartimandua, a member of a powerful family, who
ruled the <a name="fnm116" id="fnm116"></a>Brigantes.<a href="#fn116" class="fnnum">116</a> Her authority had lately increased, since
she had betrayed King Caratacus into the hands of the Romans, and
was thus considered to have provided Claudius Caesar with material
for his <a name="fnm117" id="fnm117"></a>triumph.<a href="#fn117" class="fnnum">117</a> Thus she had grown rich, and with <a name="page53" id="page53" ></a><span class="pagenum">53</span>prosperity
came demoralization. She threw over Venutius, who was her husband,
and gave her hand and kingdom to his squire, Vellocatus. This crime
soon proved the ruin of her house. The people supported her husband:
she defended her lover with passionate ferocity. Venutius therefore
summoned assistance and, aided by the simultaneous revolt of the
Brigantes, brought Cartimandua into dire straits. She petitioned for
troops from Rome. Our auxiliaries, both horse and foot, then fought
several engagements with varying success, but eventually rescued the
queen. Thus the kingdom was left in the hands of Venutius and the
war in ours.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap46" id="IIIchap46"></a><span class="chapnum">46</span>Almost simultaneously a disturbance broke out in Germany,
where the inefficiency of the generals, the disaffection of the
troops, the strength of the enemy, and the treachery of our allies
all combined to bring the Roman government into serious danger. The
causes and history of this protracted struggle&mdash;for such it
proved&mdash;we must leave to a later <a name="fnm118" id="fnm118"></a>chapter.<a href="#fn118" class="fnnum">118</a> Amongst the
<a name="fnm119" id="fnm119"></a>Dacians<a href="#fn119" class="fnnum">119</a> also there was trouble. They could never be trusted,
and now that the army was moved from Moesia they were no longer
under the restraint of fear. At first they remained quiet and
awaited developments. But when they saw Italy in the flames of war,
and found the whole empire divided into hostile camps, <a name="page54" id="page54" ></a><span class="pagenum">54</span>they fell
upon the winter-quarters of the auxiliary infantry and cavalry and
began to occupy both banks of the Danube. They were on the point of
storming the Roman camp as well, when Mucianus, who knew of the
victory at Cremona, sent the Sixth <a name="fnm120" id="fnm120"></a>legion<a href="#fn120" class="fnnum">120</a> against them. For the
empire was in danger of a double foreign invasion, if the Dacians
and the Germans had broken in from opposite directions. But here, as
so often, Rome's good fortune saved her by bringing Mucianus on the
scene with the forces of the East just at the moment when we had
settled matters at Cremona. Fonteius Agrippa, who had for the last
year been pro-consul in Asia, was transferred to the government of
Moesia. His forces were strengthened by a draft from the defeated
Vitellian army, for in the interest of peace it seemed prudent to
distribute these troops over the provinces and to keep their hands
tied by a foreign war.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap47" id="IIIchap47"></a><span class="chapnum">47</span>The other peoples soon made their voices heard. <a name="fnm121" id="fnm121"></a>Pontus<a href="#fn121" class="fnnum">121</a>
had suddenly risen in a general rebellion at the instigation of a
foreign menial, who was in command of what had once been the royal
fleet. He was one of Polemo's freedmen, by name Anicetus, who had
formerly been influential and resented the change which had
converted the kingdom into a province of the Roman empire. He
accordingly enlisted the <a name="page55" id="page55" ></a><span class="pagenum">55</span>maritime tribes of Pontus in Vitellius'
service, attracting all the neediest ruffians with promises of
plunder. At the head of no mean force he suddenly fell upon
Trapezus,<a name="fnm122" id="fnm122"></a><a href="#fn122" class="fnnum">122</a> an ancient and famous city, founded by Greek settlers
on the frontier of the Pontic kingdom. There he cut to pieces the
auxiliaries, who had once formed the king's Body Guard, and, after
receiving the Roman franchise, had adopted our ensigns and
equipment, while still retaining all the inefficiency and
insubordination of Greek troops. Anicetus also set fire to the
<a name="fnm123" id="fnm123"></a>fleet<a href="#fn123" class="fnnum">123</a> and thus enjoyed complete mastery of the sea, since
Mucianus had moved the pick of his cruisers and all his troops to
Byzantium. The sea was overrun by natives too, who had hurriedly
built themselves boats. These, which they call 'arks',<a name="fnm124" id="fnm124"></a><a href="#fn124" class="fnnum">124</a> are
broad-bottomed boats with low sides, built without any brass or iron
rivets. In a rough sea, as the waves rise higher and higher, the
height of the sides is raised by the addition of planks which, in
the end, enclose the whole boat under a sort of roof. They are thus
left to toss up and down on the waves. They have bows at both ends
and the paddles can be used on either side, since it is as easy and
as safe to row in one direction as in the other.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap48" id="IIIchap48"></a><span class="chapnum">48</span>This state of things attracting Vespasian's attention, he
was obliged to send out a picked force of detach<a name="page56" id="page56" ></a><span class="pagenum">56</span>ments from the
legions under Virdius Geminus, a soldier of tried experience. He
attacked the enemy while they were dispersed in all directions in
quest of plunder, and drove them back to their ships. He then had
some Liburnian cruisers hurriedly constructed and ran Anicetus to
ground in the mouth of the river <a name="fnm125" id="fnm125"></a>Chobus,<a href="#fn125" class="fnnum">125</a> where he had taken
refuge with the King of the Sedochezi tribe, whose alliance he had
purchased by bribes. At first, indeed, the king endeavoured to
protect his petitioner by using threats of violence, but he soon saw
that it was a choice between making war or being paid for his
treachery. The barbarian's sense of honour was unequal to this
strain. He came to terms, surrendered Anicetus and the other
fugitives, and thus put an end to 'the slaves' war'.</p>

<p>This victory delighted Vespasian: everything was succeeding beyond
his hopes: and to crown all the news of the battle of Cremona now
reached him in Egypt. He hurried forward all the faster towards
Alexandria with the object of bringing <a name="fnm126" id="fnm126"></a>starvation<a href="#fn126" class="fnnum">126</a> upon
Vitellius' defeated troops and the inhabitants of Rome, who were
already feeling the pinch of diminished imports. For he was at the
same time making preparations for an invasion of the adjacent
province of <a name="fnm127" id="fnm127"></a>Africa<a href="#fn127" class="fnnum">127</a> by land and sea. By cutting off their corn
supply he hoped to reduce the enemy to famine and disunion.</p>

<h3><a name="Antonius_Advance_Cremona" id="Antonius_Advance_Cremona"></a>Antonius' Advance from Cremona</h3>

<p><a name="IIIchap49" id="IIIchap49"></a><span class="chapnum">49</span>Thus<a name="fnm128" id="fnm128"></a><a href="#fn128" class="fnnum">128</a> a world-wide convulsion marked the passing of the
imperial power into new hands. Meanwhile, after Cremona, the
behaviour of Antonius Primus was not so blameless as before. He had
settled the war, he felt; the rest would be plain sailing. Or,
perhaps, in such a nature as his success only brought to light his
greed and arrogance and all his other dormant vices. While harrying
Italy like a conquered country, he courted the goodwill of his
troops and used every word and every action to pave his way to
power. He allowed his men to appoint centurions themselves in place
of those who had fallen, and thus gave them a taste for
insubordination; for their choice fell on the most turbulent
spirits. The generals no longer commanded the men, but were dragged
at the heels of their caprices. This revolutionary system, utterly
fatal to good discipline, was exploited by Antonius for his own
profit.<a name="fnm129" id="fnm129"></a><a href="#fn129" class="fnnum">129</a> Of Mucianus' approach he had no fears, and thus made a
mistake even more fatal than despising <a name="fnm130" id="fnm130"></a>Vespasian.<a href="#fn130" class="fnnum">130</a></p>

<p><a name="IIIchap50" id="IIIchap50"></a><span class="chapnum">50</span>His advance, however, continued. As winter was at <a name="fnm131" id="fnm131"></a>hand<a href="#fn131" class="fnnum">131</a>
and the Po had inundated the meadows, his column marched
unencumbered by heavy baggage.<a name="page58" id="page58" ></a><span class="pagenum">58</span> The main body of the victorious
legions was left behind at Verona, together with such of the
soldiers as were incapacitated by wounds or old age, and many
besides who were still in good condition. Having already broken the
back of the campaign, Antonius felt strong enough with his auxiliary
horse and foot and some picked detachments from the legions. The
<a name="fnm132" id="fnm132"></a>Eleventh<a href="#fn132" class="fnnum">132</a> had voluntarily joined the advance. They had held back
at first, but, seeing Antonius' success, were distressed to think
they had had no share in it. The column was also accompanied by a
force of six thousand Dalmatian troops, which had been recently
raised. The ex-consul, Pompeius <a name="fnm133" id="fnm133"></a>Silvanus,<a href="#fn133" class="fnnum">133</a> commanded the column,
but the actual control was in the hands of a general named Annius
Bassus. Silvanus was quite ineffective as a general, and wasted
every chance of action in talking about it. Bassus, while showing
all due respect, managed him completely, and was always ready with
quiet efficiency to do anything that had to be done. Their force was
further increased by enlisting the best of the marines from the
Ravenna fleet, who were clamouring for service in the legions. The
vacancies in the fleet were filled by Dalmatians. The army and its
generals halted at Fanum <a name="fnm134" id="fnm134"></a>Fortunae,<a href="#fn134" class="fnnum">134</a> still hesitating what policy
to adopt, for they had heard that the Guards were on the move from
Rome, and supposed that the Apennines were held by troops. And they
had fears of their own. Supplies <a name="page59" id="page59" ></a><span class="pagenum">59</span>were scarce in a district
devastated by war. The men were mutinous and demanded
'shoe-money',<a name="fnm135" id="fnm135"></a><a href="#fn135" class="fnnum">135</a> as they called the donative, with alarming
insistence. No provision had been made either for money or for
stores. The precipitate greed of the soldiers made further
difficulties, for they each looted what might have served for them
all.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap51" id="IIIchap51"></a><span class="chapnum">51</span>I find among the best authorities evidence which shows how
wickedly careless were the victorious army of all considerations of
right and wrong. They tell how a trooper professed that he had
killed his brother in the last battle, and demanded a reward from
his generals. The dictates of humanity forbade them to remunerate
such a murder, but in the interests of civil war they dared not
punish it. They had put him off with the plea that they could not at
the moment reward his service adequately. And there the story stops.
However, a similar crime had occurred in earlier civil wars. In the
battle which Pompeius Strabo fought against Cinna at the
Janiculum,<a name="fnm136" id="fnm136"></a><a href="#fn136" class="fnnum">136</a> one of his soldiers killed his own brother and then,
realizing what he had done, committed suicide. This is recorded by
Sisenna.<a name="fnm137" id="fnm137"></a><a href="#fn137" class="fnnum">137</a> Our ancestors, it seems, had a livelier sense than we
have both of the glory of good deeds <a name="page60" id="page60" ></a><span class="pagenum">60</span>and the shame of <a name="fnm138" id="fnm138"></a>bad.<a href="#fn138" class="fnnum">138</a>
These and other such instances from past history may be
appropriately cited, whenever the subject seems to demand either an
example of good conduct or some consolation for a crime.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap52" id="IIIchap52"></a><span class="chapnum">52</span>Antonius and his fellow generals decided to send the
cavalry ahead to explore the whole of Umbria, and to see whether any
of the Apennines were accessible by a gentler route; to summon the
eagles and <a name="fnm139" id="fnm139"></a>standards<a href="#fn139" class="fnnum">139</a> and all the troops at <a name="fnm140" id="fnm140"></a>Verona,<a href="#fn140" class="fnnum">140</a> and to
fill the Po and the sea with provision ships. Some of the generals
continually suggested obstacles. Antonius had grown too big for his
place, and they had surer hopes of reward from Mucianus. He was
distressed that victory had come so soon, and felt that, if he was
not present when Rome was taken, he would lose his share in the war
and its glory. So he kept on writing to Antonius and Varus in
ambiguous terms, sometimes urging them to 'press forward on their
path', sometimes expatiating on 'the manifold value of delay'. He
thus managed to arrange that he could disclaim responsibility in
case of a reverse, or acknowledge their policy as his own if it
succeeded. To Plotius Grypus, whom Vespasian had lately raised to
senatorial rank and put in command of a legion, and to his other
trusty friends he sent less ambiguous instructions, and they all
wrote back criticizing the haste with which Antonius and Varus
<a name="page61" id="page61" ></a><span class="pagenum">61</span>acted. This was just what Mucianus wanted. He forwarded the letters
to Vespasian with the result that Antonius' plans and exploits were
not appreciated as highly as Antonius had hoped. <a name="IIIchap53" id="IIIchap53"></a><span class="chapnum">53</span>This he
took very ill and threw the blame on Mucianus, whose charges he
conceived had cheapened his exploits. Being little accustomed to
control his tongue or to obey orders, he was most unguarded in his
conversation and composed a letter to Vespasian in presumptuous
language which ill befitted a subject, making various covert charges
against Mucianus. 'It was I,' he wrote, 'who brought the legions of
Pannonia into the field:<a name="fnm141" id="fnm141"></a><a href="#fn141" class="fnnum">141</a> it was my stimulus which stirred up
the officers in Moesia:<a name="fnm142" id="fnm142"></a><a href="#fn142" class="fnnum">142</a> it was by my persistence that we broke
through the Alps, seized hold of Italy and cut off the German and
Raetian <a name="fnm143" id="fnm143"></a>auxiliaries.<a href="#fn143" class="fnnum">143</a> When Vitellius' legions were all scattered
and disunited, it was I who flung the cavalry on them like a
whirlwind, and then pressed home the attack with the infantry all
day and all night. That victory is my greatest achievement and it is
entirely my own. As for the mishap at Cremona, that was the fault of
the war. In old days the civil wars cost the country far more damage
and involved the destruction of more than one town. It is not with
couriers and dispatches that I serve my master, but with my sword in
my hand. Nor can it be said that I have interfered with the glory of
the men who have meanwhile settled <a name="page62" id="page62" ></a><span class="pagenum">62</span>matters in <a name="fnm144" id="fnm144"></a>Dacia.<a href="#fn144" class="fnnum">144</a> What
peace in Moesia is to them, the safety and welfare of Italy are to
me. It was my encouragement which brought the provinces of Gaul and
of Spain, the strongest parts of the whole world, over to
Vespasian's side. But my labours will prove useless, if the reward
for the dangers I have run is to fall to the man who was not there
to share them.' All this reached the ears of Mucianus and a serious
quarrel resulted. Antonius kept it up in a frank spirit of dislike,
while Mucianus showed a cunning which was far more implacable.</p>

<h3><a name="Vitellius_Measures" id="Vitellius_Measures"></a>Vitellius' Measures of Defence</h3>

<p><a name="IIIchap54" id="IIIchap54"></a><span class="chapnum">54</span>After the crushing defeat at Cremona Vitellius stupidly
suppressed the news of the disaster, thus postponing not the danger
itself but only his precautions against it. Had he admitted the
facts and sought advice, hope and strength were still left to him:
his pretension that all went well only made matters worse. He was
himself extraordinarily silent about the war, and in Rome all
discussion of the subject was forbidden. This only increased the
number of people who, if permitted, would have told the truth, but
in the face of this prohibition spread grossly exaggerated rumours.
Nor were the Flavian leaders slow to foster these rumours. Whenever
they captured Vitellian spies they escorted them round the camp to
show them the strength of the winning army, and sent them back
<a name="page63" id="page63" ></a><span class="pagenum">63</span>again. Vitellius cross-examined each of them in private and then
had them murdered. A centurion named Julius Agrestis, after many
interviews, in which he endeavoured in vain to fire Vitellius'
courage, at last with heroic persistence induced the emperor to send
him to inspect the enemy's forces and discover what had really
happened at Cremona. He made no attempt to deceive Antonius by
concealing the object of his mission, but openly avowed the
emperor's instructions, stated his intentions and demanded to be
shown everything. He was given guides, who showed him the field of
battle, the ruins of Cremona and the captured legions. Back went
Agrestis to Vitellius. Finding that the emperor disbelieved his
report and even suggested that he had been bribed, he said, 'You
want some certain evidence and, since you have no further use for me
either alive or dead, I will give you evidence that you can
believe.' And he was as good as his word. He went straight from the
emperor's presence and committed suicide. Some say he was killed by
order of Vitellius, but they give the same account of his heroic
devotion.<a name="fnm145" id="fnm145"></a><a href="#fn145" class="fnnum">145</a></p>

<p><a name="IIIchap55" id="IIIchap55"></a><span class="chapnum">55</span>Vitellius was like a man roused from sleep. He dispatched
Julius Priscus and Alfenus <a name="fnm146" id="fnm146"></a>Varus<a href="#fn146" class="fnnum">146</a> with fourteen cohorts of
Guards and all his available cavalry to hold the Apennines. A legion
levied from <a name="page64" id="page64" ></a><span class="pagenum">64</span>the <a name="fnm147" id="fnm147"></a>marines<a href="#fn147" class="fnnum">147</a> was sent after them. This large army
of picked men and horses, if there had been any general to lead it,
was strong enough to have even taken the offensive. His other
<a name="fnm148" id="fnm148"></a>cohorts<a href="#fn148" class="fnnum">148</a> were given to his brother, Lucius Vitellius, for the
protection of the city. The emperor himself gave up none of his
habitual luxuries, but, feeling nervous and depressed, he hurried on
the elections and nominated consuls for several years in advance. He
lavished special <a name="fnm149" id="fnm149"></a>charters<a href="#fn149" class="fnnum">149</a> on allied communities and extended
Latin <a name="fnm150" id="fnm150"></a>rights<a href="#fn150" class="fnnum">150</a> to foreign towns: he remitted taxation here,
granted immunities there. In fact, he took no thought for the
future, and did his best to cripple the empire. However, the mob
accepted these munificent grants with open mouths. Fools paid money
for them, but wise men held them invalid, since they could be
neither given nor received without a revolution. At last he yielded
to the demands of the army and joined the camp at <a name="fnm151" id="fnm151"></a>Mevania,<a href="#fn151" class="fnnum">151</a>
where they had taken up their position. A long train of senators
followed him, many moved by their ambition, but most by their fears.
Here he <a name="page65" id="page65" ></a><span class="pagenum">65</span>was still undecided and at the mercy of treacherous advice.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap56" id="IIIchap56"></a><span class="chapnum">56</span>During one of his speeches a portent occurred. A cloud of
ill-omened <a name="fnm152" id="fnm152"></a>birds<a href="#fn152" class="fnnum">152</a> flew over his head and its density obscured
the daylight. To this was added another omen of disaster. A bull
broke from the altar, scattered the utensils for the ceremony, and
escaped so far away that it had to be killed instead of being
sacrificed according to the proper ritual. But the chief portent was
Vitellius himself. He was ignorant of soldiering, incapable of
forethought: knew nothing of drill or scouting, or how far
operations should be pressed forward or protracted. He always had to
ask some one else. At every fresh piece of news his expression and
gait betrayed his alarm. And then he would get drunk. At last he
found camp life too tedious, and on learning of a mutiny in the
fleet at <a name="fnm153" id="fnm153"></a>Misenum<a href="#fn153" class="fnnum">153</a> he returned to Rome. Every fresh blow
terrified him, but of the real crisis he seemed insensible. For it
was open to him to cross the Apennines and with his full strength
unimpaired to attack the enemy while they were worn out with cold
and hunger. But by breaking up his forces he sent his keenest
soldiers, stubbornly loyal to the last, to be killed or taken
prisoner. The more experienced of his centurions disapproved of this
policy and would have told him the truth, if they had been
consulted. But the emperor's intimates refused <a name="page66" id="page66" ></a><span class="pagenum">66</span>them admittance. He
had, indeed, formed a habit of regarding wholesome advice as
unpleasant, and refusing to listen to any that was not agreeable,
and in the long run fatal.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap57" id="IIIchap57"></a><span class="chapnum">57</span>In civil war individual enterprise counts for much. The
mutiny of the fleet at Misenum had been engineered by Claudius
Faventinus, a centurion whom Galba had dismissed in disgrace. To
obtain his object he had forged a letter from Vespasian promising
rewards for treachery. The admiral, Claudius <a name="fnm154" id="fnm154"></a>Apollinaris,<a href="#fn154" class="fnnum">154</a> was
neither a staunch loyalist nor an enthusiastic traitor. Accordingly
Apinius Tiro, an ex-praetor, who happened to be at <a name="fnm155" id="fnm155"></a>Minturnae,<a href="#fn155" class="fnnum">155</a>
offered to take the lead of the rebels. They proceeded to win over
the colonies and country towns. Puteoli in particular was strong for
Vespasian, while Capua remained loyal to Vitellius, for they dragged
their local jealousies into the civil war. To pacify the excited
troops Vitellius chose Claudius Julianus, who had lately been in
command of the fleet at Misenum and had allowed lax discipline. To
support him he was given one cohort of the city garrison and the
force of gladiators already serving under him. The two parties
encamped close to one another, and it was not long before Julianus
came over to Vespasian's side. They then joined forces and occupied
Tarracina,<a name="fnm156" id="fnm156"></a><a href="#fn156" class="fnnum">156</a> which owed its strength more to <a name="page67" id="page67" ></a><span class="pagenum">67</span>its walls and
situation than to the character of its new garrison.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap58" id="IIIchap58"></a><span class="chapnum">58</span>When news of this reached Vitellius, he left part of his
force at <a name="fnm157" id="fnm157"></a>Narnia<a href="#fn157" class="fnnum">157</a> with the prefects of the <a name="fnm158" id="fnm158"></a>Guard,<a href="#fn158" class="fnnum">158</a> and sent
his brother Lucius with six regiments of Guards and five hundred
horse to cope with the threatened outbreak in Campania. His own
nervous depression was somewhat relieved by the enthusiasm of the
troops and of the populace, who clamoured loudly for arms. For he
dignified this poor-spirited mob, which would never dare to do
anything but shout, by the specious titles of 'the army' or 'his
legions'. His friends were all untrustworthy in proportion to their
eminence; but on the advice of his freedmen he held a levy for
conscription and swore in all who gave their names. As their numbers
were too great, he gave the task of selection to the two consuls.
From each of the senators he levied a fixed number of slaves and a
weight of silver. The knights offered money and personal service,
while even freedmen volunteered similar assistance. Indeed,
protestations of loyalty prompted by fear, had gradually changed
into real sympathy. People began to feel pity, not perhaps so much
for Vitellius as for the throne and its misfortunes. He himself by
his looks, his voice, his tears made ceaseless demands upon their
compassion, promising rewards lavishly and, as men do when they are
frightened, beyond all limits. He had hitherto <a name="page68" id="page68" ></a><span class="pagenum">68</span>refused the title of
Caesar,<a name="fnm159" id="fnm159"></a><a href="#fn159" class="fnnum">159</a> but he now expressed a wish for it. He had a
superstitious respect for the name, and in moments of terror one
listens as much to gossip as to sound advice. However, while a rash
and ill-conceived undertaking may prosper at the outset, in time it
always begins to flag. Gradually the senators and knights deserted
him. At first they hesitated and waited till his back was turned,
but soon they ceased to care and openly showed their disrespect. At
last Vitellius grew ashamed of the failure of his efforts and
excused them from the services which they refused to render.</p>

<h3><a name="The_Passage" id="The_Passage"></a>The Passage of the Apennines</h3>

<p><a name="IIIchap59" id="IIIchap59"></a><span class="chapnum">59</span>The occupation of <a name="fnm160" id="fnm160"></a>Mevania<a href="#fn160" class="fnnum">160</a> had terrified Italy with the
prospect of a revival of the war, but Vitellius' cowardly
<a name="fnm161" id="fnm161"></a>retreat<a href="#fn161" class="fnnum">161</a> sensibly strengthened the popularity of the Flavian
party. The Samnites, Pelignians, and Marsians were now induced to
rise. They were jealous of Campania for stealing a march on them,
and the change of masters, as so often happens, made them perform
all their military duties with the utmost alacrity. But in crossing
the Apennines Antonius' army suffered severely from the rough
December weather. Though they met with no opposition, they found it
hard enough to struggle through the snow, and realized what danger
they would have had to face if Vitellius had not happened to turn
back. Certainly chance helped the Flavian generals quite as often
<a name="page69" id="page69" ></a><span class="pagenum">69</span>as their own strategy. Here they came across Petilius
Cerialis,<a name="fnm162" id="fnm162"></a><a href="#fn162" class="fnnum">162</a> who had been enabled by his knowledge of the country
to elude Vitellius' outposts, disguised as a peasant. As he was a
near relative of Vespasian and a distinguished soldier he was given
a place on the staff. Several authorities say that Flavius Sabinus
and <a name="fnm163" id="fnm163"></a>Domitian<a href="#fn163" class="fnnum">163</a> were also afforded facilities for escape, and that
Antonius sent messengers who contrived by various devices to get
through to them, and made arrangements for an interview and safe
conduct. Sabinus, however, pleaded that his health was unequal to
the fatigue of such a bold step. Domitian was quite ready to
venture, but although the guards to whom Vitellius had entrusted
him, promised that they would share his flight, he was afraid they
might be laying a trap for him. As a matter of fact, Vitellius was
too anxious for the safety of his own relatives to plot any harm
against Domitian.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap60" id="IIIchap60"></a><span class="chapnum">60</span>Arrived at <a name="fnm164" id="fnm164"></a>Carsulae<a href="#fn164" class="fnnum">164</a> the Flavian generals took a few
days' rest and awaited the arrival of the main legionary <a name="fnm165" id="fnm165"></a>force.<a href="#fn165" class="fnnum">165</a>
The place suited them admirably for an encampment. It commanded a
wide view, and with so many prosperous towns in the rear their
supplies were safe. The Vitellians too, were only ten miles away,
and they had hopes of negotiating treason <a name="page70" id="page70" ></a><span class="pagenum">70</span>with them. The soldiers
chafed at this delay, preferring victory to peace. They did not even
want to wait for their own legions, for there would be more plunder
than danger to share with them. Antonius accordingly summoned a
meeting of the men and explained to them that Vitellius still had
troops at his command. Reflection might make them waver, despair
would steel their hearts. In civil war, he told them, the first
steps may be left to chance, nothing but careful strategy can win
the final victory. The fleet at Misenum and the richest districts of
Campania had already deserted Vitellius, and in the whole world
nothing was left to him now except the country between Narnia and
Tarracina. The battle of Cremona had brought them credit enough, and
the destruction of the town more than enough discredit. Their desire
must be not to take Rome but to save it. They would gain richer
rewards and far more glory if they could show that they had saved
the senate and people of Rome without shedding a drop of blood. Such
considerations as these calmed their excitement, and it was not long
before the legions arrived.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap61" id="IIIchap61"></a><span class="chapnum">61</span>Alarmed at the repute of this augmented army, Vitellius'
Guards began to waver. There was no one to encourage them to fight,
while many urged them to desert, being eager to hand over their
companies or squadrons to the enemy and by such a gift to secure the
victor's gratitude for the future. These also let the Flavians know
that the next camp at <a name="fnm166" id="fnm166"></a>Interamna<a href="#fn166" class="fnnum">166</a><a name="page71" id="page71" ></a><span class="pagenum">71</span> had a garrison of four hundred
cavalry. Varus was promptly sent off with a light marching force,
and the few who offered resistance were killed. The majority threw
away their arms and begged for quarter. Some escaped to the main
<a name="fnm167" id="fnm167"></a>camp<a href="#fn167" class="fnnum">167</a> and spread universal panic by exaggerating the strength
and prowess of the enemy, in order to mitigate the disgrace of
losing the fort. In the Vitellian camp all offences went unpunished:
desertion met with sure reward. Their loyalty soon gave way and a
competition in treachery began. Tribunes and centurions deserted
daily, but not the common soldiers, who had grown stubbornly
faithful to Vitellius. At last, however, Priscus and <a name="fnm168" id="fnm168"></a>Alfenus<a href="#fn168" class="fnnum">168</a>
abandoned the camp and returned to Vitellius, thus finally releasing
all the others from any obligation to blush for their treachery.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap62" id="IIIchap62"></a><span class="chapnum">62</span>About the same time Fabius <a name="fnm169" id="fnm169"></a>Valens<a href="#fn169" class="fnnum">169</a> was executed in his
prison at Urbinum, and his head was exhibited to Vitellius' Guards
to show them that further hope was vain. For they cherished a belief
that Valens had made his way into Germany, and was there mustering
his old force and fresh troops as well. This evidence of his death
threw them into despair. The Flavian army was vastly inspirited by
it and regarded Valens' death as the end of the war.</p>

<p>Valens had been born at Anagnia of an equestrian family. He was a
man of loose morality, not without intellectual gifts, who by
indulging in frivolity <a name="page72" id="page72" ></a><span class="pagenum">72</span>posed as a wit. In Nero's time he had acted
in a harlequinade at the Juvenalian <a name="fnm170" id="fnm170"></a>Games.<a href="#fn170" class="fnnum">170</a> At first he pleaded
compulsion, but afterwards he acted voluntarily, and his
performances were rather clever than respectable. Rising to the
command of a legion, he supported <a name="fnm171" id="fnm171"></a>Verginius<a href="#fn171" class="fnnum">171</a> and then defamed
his character. He murdered Fonteius Capito,<a href="#fn171" class="fnnum">171</a> whose loyalty he
had undermined&mdash;or perhaps because he had failed to do so. He
betrayed Galba and remained faithful to Vitellius, a merit to which
the treachery of others served as a foil.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap63" id="IIIchap63"></a><span class="chapnum">63</span>Now that their hopes were crushed on all sides, the
Vitellians prepared to go over to the enemy. But even at this crisis
they saved their honour by marching down with their standards and
colours to the plains below Narnia, where the Flavian army was drawn
up in full armour ready for battle in two deep lines on either side
of the road. The Vitellians marched in between and were surrounded.
Antonius then spoke to them kindly and told them to remain, some at
Narnia and some at Interamna. He also left behind some of the
victorious legions, which were strong enough to quell any outbreak
but would not molest them so long as they remained quiet.</p>

<h3><a name="The_Abdication" id="The_Abdication"></a>The Abdication of Vitellius and the Burning of the Capitol</h3>

<p>During these days Antonius and Varus kept sending messages to
Vitellius, in which they offered him his life, a gift of money, and
the choice of a safe retreat in Campania, if he would stop the war
and surrender himself and his children to Vespasian. Mucianus wrote
him letters to the same effect. Vitellius usually took these offers
seriously and talked about the number of slaves he would have and
the choice of a seaside place. He had sunk, indeed, into such mental
torpor that, if other people had not remembered that he was an
emperor, he was certainly beginning to forget it himself.
<a name="IIIchap64" id="IIIchap64"></a><span class="chapnum">64</span>However, it was to Flavius Sabinus, the City Prefect, that
the leading men at Rome addressed themselves. They urged him
secretly not to lose all share in the glory of victory. They pointed
out that the City Garrison was under his own command, and that he
could count on the police and their own bands of slaves, to say
nothing of the good fortune of the party and all the advantage that
victory gives. He must not leave all the glory to Antonius and
Varus. Vitellius had nothing left but a few regiments of guards, who
were seriously alarmed at the bad news which came from every
quarter. As for the populace, their feelings soon changed, and if he
put himself at their head, they would be just as loud in their
flattery of Vespasian. Vitellius himself could not even cope <a name="page74" id="page74" ></a><span class="pagenum">74</span>with
success, and disaster had positively paralysed him. The credit of
ending the war would go to the man who seized the city. It was
eminently fitting that Sabinus should secure the throne for his
brother, and that Vespasian should hold him higher than any one
else.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap65" id="IIIchap65"></a><span class="chapnum">65</span>Age had enfeebled Sabinus, and he showed no alacrity to
listen to such talk as this. Some people covertly insinuated that he
was jealous of his brother's success and was trying to delay its
realization. Flavius Sabinus was the elder brother and, while they
were both private persons, he had been the richer and more
influential. It was also believed that he had been chary in helping
Vespasian to recover his financial position, and had taken a
mortgage on his house and estates. Consequently, though they
remained openly friendly, there were suspicions of a secret enmity
between them. The more charitable explanation is that Sabinus's
gentle nature shrank from the idea of bloodshed and massacre, and
that this was his reason for so constantly discussing with Vitellius
the prospects of peace and a capitulation on terms. After several
interviews at his house they finally came to a settlement&mdash;so the
report went&mdash;at the Temple of <a name="fnm172" id="fnm172"></a>Apollo.<a href="#fn172" class="fnnum">172</a> To the actual
conversation there were only two witnesses, Cluvius <a name="fnm173" id="fnm173"></a>Rufus<a href="#fn173" class="fnnum">173</a> and
Silius <a name="fnm174" id="fnm174"></a>Italicus,<a href="#fn174" class="fnnum">174</a> but the expression of their faces was watched
from a distance.<a name="page75" id="page75" ></a><span class="pagenum">75</span> Vitellius was said to look abject and demoralized:
Sabinus showed less sign of pride than of pity.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap66" id="IIIchap66"></a><span class="chapnum">66</span>Had Vitellius found it no harder to persuade his friends
than to make his own renunciation, Vespasian's army might have
marched into Rome without bloodshed. But as it was, each of his
friends in proportion to his loyalty persisted in refusing terms of
peace. They pointed to the danger and disgrace. Would their
conqueror keep his promises any longer than he liked? However great
Vespasian's self-confidence, he could not allow Vitellius to live in
private. Nor would the losers acquiesce: their very pity would be a
menace.<a name="fnm175" id="fnm175"></a><a href="#fn175" class="fnnum">175</a> 'Of course,' they said, 'you are an old man. You have
done with fortune, good or bad. But what sort of repute or position
would your son <a name="fnm176" id="fnm176"></a>Germanicus<a href="#fn176" class="fnnum">176</a> enjoy? At present they are promising
you money and a household, and the pleasant shores of Campania. But
when once Vespasian has seized the throne, neither he nor his
friends nor even his army will feel their safety assured until the
rival claimant is dead. They imprisoned Fabius Valens and meant to
make use of him if a crisis occurred, but they found him too great
an incubus. You may be sure that Antonius and Fuscus and that
typical representative of the party, Mucianus, will have no choice
but to kill you. Julius Caesar did not let Pompey live unmolested,
nor Augustus <a name="fnm177" id="fnm177"></a>Antony.<a href="#fn177" class="fnnum">177</a><a name="page76" id="page76" ></a><span class="pagenum">76</span> Do you suppose that Vespasian's is a
loftier disposition? Why, he was one of your father's
dependants,<a name="fnm178" id="fnm178"></a><a href="#fn178" class="fnnum">178</a> when your father was Claudius's <a name="fnm179" id="fnm179"></a>colleague.<a href="#fn179" class="fnnum">179</a> No,
think of your father's censorship, his three consulships,<a href="#fn179" class="fnnum">179</a> and
all the honour your great house has won. You must not disgrace them.
Despair, at least, should nerve your courage. The troops are
steadfast; you still enjoy the people's favour. Indeed, nothing
worse can happen to you than what we are eager to face of our own
free will. If we are defeated, we must die; if we surrender, we must
die. All that matters is whether we breathe our last amid mockery
and insult or bravely and with honour.'</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap67" id="IIIchap67"></a><span class="chapnum">67</span>But Vitellius was deaf to all courageous counsel. His mind
was obsessed with pity for his wife and children, and an anxious
fear that obstinate resistance might make the conqueror merciless
towards them. He had also a <a name="fnm180" id="fnm180"></a>mother,<a href="#fn180" class="fnnum">180</a> very old and infirm, but
she had opportunely died a few days before and thus forestalled the
ruin of her house. All she had got out of her son's principate was
sorrow and a good name. On December 17 he heard the news that the
legion and the Guards at Narnia had deserted him and surrendered to
the enemy. He at once put on mourning and left the palace,
surrounded by his sorrowful household. His small son was carried in
a little litter, as though this had been his funeral. The populace
<a name="page77" id="page77" ></a><span class="pagenum">77</span>uttered untimely flatteries: the soldiers kept an ominous silence.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap68" id="IIIchap68"></a><span class="chapnum">68</span>On that day there was no one so indifferent to the tragedy
of human life as to be unmoved by this spectacle. A Roman emperor,
yesterday master of the inhabited world, had left the seat of his
authority, and was now passing through the streets of the city,
through the crowding populace, quitting the throne. Such a sight had
never been seen or heard of before. The dictator, Caesar, had been
the victim of sudden violence; Caligula of a secret conspiracy.
Nero's had been a stealthy flight to some obscure country house
under cover of night. Piso and Galba might almost be said to have
fallen on the field of battle. But here was Vitellius&mdash;before the
assembly of his own people, his own soldiers around him, with women
even looking on&mdash;uttering a few sentences suitable to his miserable
situation. He said it was in the interest of peace and of his
country that he now resigned. He begged them only to retain his
memory in their hearts and to take pity on his brother, his wife,
and his little innocent children. As he said this, he held out his
son to them and commended him, now to individuals, now to the whole
assembly. At last tears choked his voice. Turning to the consul,
Caecilius <a name="fnm181" id="fnm181"></a>Simplex,<a href="#fn181" class="fnnum">181</a> who was standing by, he unstrapped his sword
and offered to surrender it as a symbol of his power over the life
and death of his subjects. The consul refused. The people in the
assembly shouted 'No'. So he left them with the <a name="page78" id="page78" ></a><span class="pagenum">78</span>intention of
depositing the regalia in the Temple of Concord and then going to
his brother's house. But he was faced with a still louder uproar.
They refused to let him enter a private house, and shouted to him to
return to the palace. They blocked every other way and only left the
road leading into the Via Sacra <a name="fnm182" id="fnm182"></a>open.<a href="#fn182" class="fnnum">182</a> Not knowing what else to
do, Vitellius returned to the palace.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap69" id="IIIchap69"></a><span class="chapnum">69</span>A rumour of his abdication had preceded him, and Flavius
Sabinus had sent written instructions to the Guards'<a name="fnm183" id="fnm183"></a><a href="#fn183" class="fnnum">183</a> officers
to keep the men in hand. Thus the whole empire seemed to have fallen
into Vespasian's lap. The chief senators, the majority of the
knights, and the whole of the city garrison and the police came
flocking to the house of Flavius Sabinus. There they heard the news
of the popular enthusiasm for Vitellius and the threatening attitude
of the German <a name="fnm184" id="fnm184"></a>Guards.<a href="#fn184" class="fnnum">184</a> But Sabinus had gone too far to draw
back, and when he showed hesitation, they all began to urge him to
fight, each being afraid for his own safety if the Vitellians were
to fall on them when they were disunited and consequently weaker.
However, as so often happens on these occasions, every one offered
to give <a name="page79" id="page79" ></a><span class="pagenum">79</span>advice but few to share the danger. While Sabinus' Body
Guard were marching down by the Fundane <a name="fnm185" id="fnm185"></a>reservoir<a href="#fn185" class="fnnum">185</a> they were
attacked by some of the most determined Vitellians. The surprise was
unpremeditated, but the Vitellians got the best of an unimportant
skirmish. In the panic Sabinus chose what was at the moment the
safest course, and occupied the summit of the <a name="fnm186" id="fnm186"></a>Capitol,<a href="#fn186" class="fnnum">186</a> where
his troops were joined by a few senators and knights. It is not easy
to record their names, since after Vespasian's victory crowds of
people claimed credit for this service to the party. There were even
some women who endured the siege, the most famous of them being
Verulana Gratilla, who had neither children nor relatives to attract
her, but only her love of <a name="fnm187" id="fnm187"></a>danger.<a href="#fn187" class="fnnum">187</a></p>

<p>The Vitellians, who were investing them, kept a half-hearted watch,
and Sabinus was thus enabled to send for his own children and his
nephew Domitian at dead of night, dispatching a courier by an
unguarded route to tell the Flavian generals that he and his men
were under siege, and would be in great straits unless they were
rescued. All night, indeed, he was quite unmolested, and could have
escaped with perfect safety. The Vitellian troops could face danger
with spirit, but were much too careless in the task of keeping
guard; <a name="page80" id="page80" ></a><span class="pagenum">80</span>besides which a sudden storm of chilly rain interfered with
their sight and hearing.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap70" id="IIIchap70"></a><span class="chapnum">70</span>At daybreak, before the two sides commenced hostilities,
Sabinus sent Cornelius Martialis, who had been a senior centurion,
to Vitellius with instructions to complain that the conditions were
being violated; that he had evidently made a mere empty show of
abdication, meant to deceive a number of eminent gentlemen. Else why
had he gone from the meeting to his brother's house, which caught
the eye from a conspicuous position overlooking the Forum, and not
rather to his wife's on the Aventine. That was the proper course for
a private citizen, anxious to avoid all pretension to supreme
authority. But no, Vitellius had returned to the palace, the very
stronghold of imperial majesty. From there he had launched a column
of armed men, who had strewn with innocent dead the most crowded
quarter of Rome, and even laid violent hands upon the Capitol. As
for Sabinus himself, the messenger was to say, he was only a
civilian, a mere member of the senate. While the issue was being
decided between Vespasian and Vitellius by the engagement of
legions, the capture of towns, the capitulation of cohorts; even
when the provinces of Spain, of Germany, of Britain, had risen in
revolt; he, though Vespasian's brother, had still remained faithful
to his allegiance, until Vitellius, unasked, began to invite him to
a conference. Peace and union, he was to remind him, serve the
interest of the losers, and only the reputation of the winners. If
Vitellius <a name="page81" id="page81" ></a><span class="pagenum">81</span>regretted their compact, he ought not to take arms
against Sabinus, whom he had treacherously deceived, and against
Vespasian's son, who was still a mere boy. What was the good of
killing one youth and one old man? He ought rather to march out
against the legions and fight for the empire on the field. The
result of the battle would decide all other questions.</p>

<p>Greatly alarmed, Vitellius replied with a few words in which he
tried to excuse himself and throw the blame on his soldiers. 'I am
too unassuming,' he said, 'to cope with their overpowering
impatience.' He then warned Martialis to make his way out of the
house by a secret passage, for fear that the soldiers should kill
him as an ambassador of the peace to which they were so hostile.
Vitellius himself was not in a position to issue orders or
prohibitions; no longer an emperor, merely an excuse for war.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap71" id="IIIchap71"></a><span class="chapnum">71</span>Martialis had hardly returned to the Capitol when the
furious soldiery arrived. They had no general to lead them: each was
a law to himself. Their column marched at full speed through the
Forum and past the temples overlooking it. Then in battle order they
advanced up the steep hill in front of them, until they reached the
lowest gates of the fortress on the Capitol. In old days there was a
series of colonnades at the side of this slope, on the right as you
go up. Emerging on to the roof of these, the besieged overwhelmed
the Vitellians with showers of stones and tiles. The attacking party
carried nothing but swords, and it seemed a long business to send
for siege-engines and <a name="page82" id="page82" ></a><span class="pagenum">82</span>missiles. So they flung torches into the
<a name="fnm188" id="fnm188"></a>nearest<a href="#fn188" class="fnnum">188</a> colonnade and, following in the wake of the flames,
would have burst through the burnt gates of the Capitol, if Sabinus
had not torn down all the available statues&mdash;the monuments of our
ancestors' glory&mdash;and built a sort of barricade on the very
threshold. They then tried to attack the Capitol by two opposite
approaches, one near the 'Grove of Refuge'<a name="fnm189" id="fnm189"></a><a href="#fn189" class="fnnum">189</a> and the other by the
hundred steps which lead up to the Tarpeian Rock. This double
assault came as a surprise. That by the Refuge was the closer and
more vigorous. Nothing could stop the Vitellians, who climbed up by
some contiguous houses built on to the side of the hill, which in
the days of prolonged peace had been raised to such a height that
their roofs were level with the floor of the Capitol. It is
uncertain whether the buildings at this point were fired by the
assailants or&mdash;as tradition prefers&mdash;by the besieged in trying to
dislodge their enemies who had struggled up so far. The fire spread
to the colonnades adjoining the temples, and then the 'eagles'<a name="fnm190" id="fnm190"></a><a href="#fn190" class="fnnum">190</a>
supporting the roof, which were made of very old wood, caught the
flames and fed them. And so the Capitol, with its doors fast shut,
undefended and unplundered, was burnt to the ground.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap72" id="IIIchap72"></a><span class="chapnum">72</span>Since the foundation of the city no such deplorable and
horrible disaster had ever befallen the people of<a name="page83" id="page83" ></a><span class="pagenum">83</span> Rome. It was no
case of foreign invasion. Had our own wickedness allowed, the
country might have been enjoying the blessings of a benign
Providence; and yet here was the seat of Jupiter Almighty&mdash;the
temple solemnly founded by our ancestors as the pledge of their
imperial greatness, on which not even <a name="fnm191" id="fnm191"></a>Porsenna,<a href="#fn191" class="fnnum">191</a> when Rome
surrendered, nor the Gauls, when they took it, had ever dared to lay
rash hands&mdash;being brought utterly to ruin by the mad folly of two
rival emperors!<a name="fnm192" id="fnm192"></a><a href="#fn192" class="fnnum">192</a> The Capitol had been burnt before in civil
war,<a name="fnm193" id="fnm193"></a><a href="#fn193" class="fnnum">193</a> but that was the crime of private persons. Now it had been
openly assaulted by the people of Rome and openly burnt by them. And
what was the cause of war? what the recompense for such a disaster?
Were we fighting for our country?</p>

<p>King Tarquinius Priscus had vowed to build this temple in the Sabine
war, and had laid the foundations on a scale that suited rather his
hope of the city's future greatness than the still moderate fortunes
of the Roman people. Later Servius Tullius, with the aid of Rome's
allies, and Tarquinius Superbus, with the spoils of the Volscians
after the capture of Suessa <a name="fnm194" id="fnm194"></a>Pometia,<a href="#fn194" class="fnnum">194</a> continued the building.
But the glory of completing it was reserved for the days of freedom.
After the expulsion of the kings, Horatius Pulvillus, <a name="page84" id="page84" ></a><span class="pagenum">84</span>in his second
<a name="fnm195" id="fnm195"></a>consulship<a href="#fn195" class="fnnum">195</a> dedicated this monument on such a magnificent scale,
that in later days, with all her boundless wealth, Rome has been
able to embellish but never to enlarge it. After an interval of four
hundred and fifteen years, in the consulship of Lucius Scipio and
Caius <a name="fnm196" id="fnm196"></a>Norbanus,<a href="#fn196" class="fnnum">196</a> it was burnt and rebuilt on the same site.
Sulla after his victory undertook the task of restoring it, but did
not dedicate it. This only was lacking to justify his title of
'Fortune's Favourite'.<a name="fnm197" id="fnm197"></a><a href="#fn197" class="fnnum">197</a> Much as the emperors did to it, the name
of Lutatius <a name="fnm198" id="fnm198"></a>Catulus<a href="#fn198" class="fnnum">198</a> still remained upon it up to the time of
Vitellius.<a name="fnm199" id="fnm199"></a><a href="#fn199" class="fnnum">199</a> This was the temple that was now ablaze.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap73" id="IIIchap73"></a><span class="chapnum">73</span>The besieged suffered more panic than their assailants. The
Vitellian soldiers lacked neither resource nor steadiness in moments
of crisis. But on the other side the troops were terrified, the
<a name="fnm200" id="fnm200"></a>general<a href="#fn200" class="fnnum">200</a> inert, and apparently so paralysed that he was
practically deaf and dumb. He neither adopted others' plans nor
formed any of his own, but only drifted about from place to place,
attracted by the shouts of the enemy, contradicting all his own
orders. The result was what always happens in a hopeless disaster:
everybody gave orders and nobody obeyed them. At last they threw
away their weapons and began to peer round for <a name="page85" id="page85" ></a><span class="pagenum">85</span>a way of escape or
some means of hiding. Then the Vitellians came bursting in, and with
fire and sword made one red havoc. A few good soldiers dared to show
fight and were cut to pieces. Of these the most notable were
Cornelius <a name="fnm201" id="fnm201"></a>Martialis,<a href="#fn201" class="fnnum">201</a> Aemilius <a name="fnm202" id="fnm202"></a>Pacensis,<a href="#fn202" class="fnnum">202</a> Casperius Niger,
and Didius Scaeva. Flavius Sabinus, who stood unarmed and making no
attempt to escape, was surrounded together with the consul Quintius
Atticus,<a name="fnm203" id="fnm203"></a><a href="#fn203" class="fnnum">203</a> whose empty title made him a marked man, as well as
his personal vanity, which had led him to distribute manifestoes
full of compliments to Vespasian and insults against Vitellius. The
rest escaped by various means. Some disguised themselves as slaves:
some were sheltered by faithful dependants: some hid among the
baggage. Others again caught the Vitellians' password, by which they
recognized each other, and actually went about demanding it and
giving it when challenged, thus escaping under a cloak of
effrontery.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap74" id="IIIchap74"></a><span class="chapnum">74</span>When the enemy first broke in, Domitian had taken refuge
with the sacristan, and was enabled by the ingenuity of a freedman
to escape among a crowd of worshippers in a linen <a name="fnm204" id="fnm204"></a>dress,<a href="#fn204" class="fnnum">204</a> and to
take refuge near the Velabrum with Cornelius Primus, one of his
father's dependants. When his father came to the throne, Domitian
pulled down the sacristan's lodging and <a name="page86" id="page86" ></a><span class="pagenum">86</span>built a little chapel to
Jupiter the Saviour with an altar, on which his adventures were
depicted in marble relief. Later, when he became emperor, he
dedicated a huge temple to Jupiter the Guardian with a statue of
himself in the lap of the god.</p>

<p>Sabinus and Atticus were loaded with chains and taken to Vitellius,
who received them without any language or looks of disfavour, much
to the chagrin of those who wanted to see them punished with death
and themselves rewarded for their successful labours. When those who
stood nearest started an outcry, the dregs of the populace soon
began to demand Sabinus' execution with mingled threats and
flatteries. Vitellius came out on to the steps of the palace
prepared to plead for him: but they forced him to desist. Sabinus
was stabbed and riddled with wounds: his head was cut off and the
trunk dragged away to the Ladder <a name="IIIchap75" id="IIIchap75"></a><span class="chapnum">75</span>of <a name="fnm205" id="fnm205"></a>Sighs.<a href="#fn205" class="fnnum">205</a> Such was
the end of a man who certainly merits no contempt. He had served his
country for thirty-five years, and won credit both as civilian and
soldier. His integrity and fairness were beyond criticism. He talked
too much about himself, but this is the one charge which rumour
could hint against him in the seven years when he was Governor of
Moesia, and the twelve years during which he was Prefect of the
City. At the end of his life some thought he showed a lack of
enterprise, but many believed him <a name="page87" id="page87" ></a><span class="pagenum">87</span>a moderate man, who was anxious
to save his fellow citizens from bloodshed. In this, at any rate,
all would agree, that before Vespasian became emperor the reputation
of his house rested on Sabinus. It is said that Mucianus was
delighted to hear of his murder, and many people maintained that it
served the interests of peace by putting an end to the jealousy of
two rivals, one of whom was the emperor's brother, while the other
posed as his partner in the <a name="fnm206" id="fnm206"></a>empire.<a href="#fn206" class="fnnum">206</a></p>

<p>When the people further demanded the execution of the consul,
Vitellius withstood them. He had forgiven Atticus, and felt that he
owed him a favour, for, when asked who had set fire to the Capitol,
Atticus had taken the blame on himself, by which avowal&mdash;or was it a
well-timed falsehood?&mdash;he had fixed all the guilt and odium on
himself and exonerated the Vitellian party.</p>

<h3><a name="The_Taking" id="The_Taking"></a>The Taking of Tarracina</h3>

<p><a name="IIIchap76" id="IIIchap76"></a><span class="chapnum">76</span>About this same time Lucius <a name="fnm207" id="fnm207"></a>Vitellius,<a href="#fn207" class="fnnum">207</a> who had pitched
his camp at the Temple of <a name="fnm208" id="fnm208"></a>Feronia,<a href="#fn208" class="fnnum">208</a> made every effort to destroy
Tarracina, where he had shut up the gladiators and sailors, who
would not venture to leave the shelter of the walls or to face death
in the open. The gladiators were commanded, as we have already
seen,<a name="fnm209" id="fnm209"></a><a href="#fn209" class="fnnum">209</a> by Julianus, and the sailors by<a name="page88" id="page88" ></a><span class="pagenum">88</span> Apollinaris, men whose
dissolute inefficiency better suited gladiators than general
officers. They set no watch, and made no attempt to repair the weak
places in the walls. Day and night they idled loosely; the soldiers
were dispatched in all directions to find them luxuries; that
beautiful coast rang with their revelry; and they only spoke of war
in their cups. A few days earlier, Apinius <a name="fnm210" id="fnm210"></a>Tiro<a href="#fn210" class="fnnum">210</a> had started on
his mission, and, by rigorously requisitioning gifts of money in all
the country towns, was winning more unpopularity than assistance for
the cause.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap77" id="IIIchap77"></a><span class="chapnum">77</span>In the meantime, one of Vergilius Capito's slaves deserted
to Lucius Vitellius, and promised that, if he were provided with
men, he would put the abandoned castle into their hands.
Accordingly, at dead of night he established a few lightly armed
cohorts on the top of the hills which overlooked the enemy. Thence
the soldiers came charging down more to butchery than battle. They
cut down their victims standing helpless and unarmed or hunting for
their weapons, or perhaps newly startled from their sleep&mdash;all in a
bewildering confusion of darkness, panic, bugle-calls, and savage
cries. A few of the gladiators resisted and sold their lives dearly.
The rest rushed to the ships; and there the same panic and confusion
reigned, for the villagers were all mixed up with the troops, and
the Vitellians slaughtered them too, without distinction. Just as
the <a name="page89" id="page89" ></a><span class="pagenum">89</span>first uproar began, six Liburnian cruisers slipped away with
the admiral Apollinaris on board. The rest were either captured on
the beach or overweighted and sunk by the crowds that clambered over
them. Julianus was taken to Lucius Vitellius, who had him flogged
till he bled and then killed before his eyes. Some writers have
accused Lucius Vitellius' wife, <a name="fnm211" id="fnm211"></a>Triaria,<a href="#fn211" class="fnnum">211</a> of putting on a
soldier's sword, and with insolent cruelty showing herself among the
horrors of the captured town. Lucius himself sent a laurel-wreath to
his brother in token of his success, and inquired whether he wished
him to return at once or to continue reducing Campania. This delay
saved not only Vespasian's party but Rome as well. Had he marched on
the city while his men were fresh from their victory, with the flush
of success added to their natural intrepidity, there would have been
a tremendous struggle, which must have involved the city's
destruction. Lucius Vitellius, too, for all his evil repute, was a
man of action. Good men owe their power to their virtues; but he was
one of that worst sort whose vices are their only virtue.</p>

<h3><a name="The_Sack" id="The_Sack"></a>The Sack of Rome and the end of Vitellius</h3>

<p><a name="IIIchap78" id="IIIchap78"></a><span class="chapnum">78</span>While <a name="fnm212" id="fnm212"></a>things<a href="#fn212" class="fnnum">212</a> went thus on Vitellius' side, the Flavian
army after leaving Narnia spent the days of <a name="page90" id="page90" ></a><span class="pagenum">90</span>the Saturnalian
<a name="fnm213" id="fnm213"></a>holiday<a href="#fn213" class="fnnum">213</a> quietly at <a name="fnm214" id="fnm214"></a>Ocriculum.<a href="#fn214" class="fnnum">214</a> The object of this
disastrous delay was to wait for Mucianus. Antonius has been
suspected of delaying treacherously after receiving a secret
communication from Vitellius, offering him as the price of treason
the consulship, his young daughter, and a rich dowry. Others hold
that this story was invented to gratify Mucianus. Many consider that
the policy of all the Flavian generals was rather to threaten the
city than to attack it. They realized that Vitellius had lost the
best cohorts of his Guards, and now that all his forces were cut off
they expected he would abdicate. But this prospect was spoilt first
by Sabinus' precipitation and then by his cowardice, for, after very
rashly taking arms, he failed to defend against three cohorts of
Guards the strongly fortified castle on the Capitol, which ought to
have been impregnable even to a large army. However, it is not easy
to assign to any one man the blame which they all share. Even
Mucianus helped to delay the victors' advance by the ambiguity of
his dispatches, and Antonius was also to blame for his untimely
compliance with instructions&mdash;or else for trying to throw the
<a name="fnm215" id="fnm215"></a>responsibility<a href="#fn215" class="fnnum">215</a> on Mucianus. The other generals thought the war
was over, and thus rendered its final scene all the more appalling.
Petilius Cerialis was sent forward with a thousand cavalry to <a name="page91" id="page91" ></a><span class="pagenum">91</span>make
his way by cross-roads through the Sabine country, and enter the
city by the Salarian <a name="fnm216" id="fnm216"></a>road.<a href="#fn216" class="fnnum">216</a> But even he failed to make
sufficient haste, and at last the news of the siege of the Capitol
brought them all at once to their senses.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap79" id="IIIchap79"></a><span class="chapnum">79</span>Marching up the Flaminian road, it was already deep night
when Antonius reached 'The Red Rocks'.<a name="fnm217" id="fnm217"></a><a href="#fn217" class="fnnum">217</a> His help had come too
late. There he heard that Sabinus had been killed, and the Capitol
burnt; the city was in panic; everything looked black; even the
populace and the slaves were arming for Vitellius. Petilius
Cerialis, too, had been defeated in a cavalry engagement. He had
pushed on without caution, thinking the enemy already beaten, and
the Vitellians with a mixed force of horse and foot had caught him
unawares. The engagement had taken place near the city among farm
buildings and gardens and winding lanes, with which the Vitellians
were familiar, while the Flavians were terrified by their ignorance.
Besides, the troopers were not all of one mind; some of them
belonged to the force which had recently surrendered at Narnia, and
were waiting to see which side won. Julius Flavianus, who commanded
a regiment of cavalry, was taken prisoner. The rest fell into a
disgraceful panic and fled, but the pursuit was not continued beyond
Fidenae.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap80" id="IIIchap80"></a><span class="chapnum">80</span>This success served to increase the popular excitement. The
city rabble now took arms. A few had service-shields: most of them
snatched up any weapons <a name="page92" id="page92" ></a><span class="pagenum">92</span>they could find and clamoured to be given
the sign for battle. Vitellius expressed his gratitude to them and
bade them sally forth to protect the city. He then summoned a
meeting of the senate, at which envoys were appointed to go to the
two armies and urge them in the name of public welfare to accept
peace. The fortunes of the envoys varied. Those who approached
Petilius Cerialis found themselves in dire danger, for the soldiers
indignantly refused their terms. The praetor, Arulenus
Rusticus,<a name="fnm218" id="fnm218"></a><a href="#fn218" class="fnnum">218</a> was wounded. Apart from the wrong done to a praetor
and an envoy, the man's own acknowledged worth made this seem all
the more scandalous. His companions were flogged, and the lictor
nearest to him was killed for venturing to make a way through the
crowd. Indeed, if the guard provided by the general had not
intervened, a Roman envoy, the sanctity of whose person even foreign
nations respect, might have been wickedly murdered in the mad rage
of civil strife under the very walls of Rome. Those who went to
Antonius met with a more reasonable reception; not that the soldiers
were less violent, but the general had more authority.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap81" id="IIIchap81"></a><span class="chapnum">81</span>A knight named Musonius Rufus had attached himself to the
envoys. He was a student of philosophy and an enthusiastic advocate
of Stoicism. He mingled with the armed soldiers offering them advice
and discoursing on the advantages of peace and the perils of war.
This amused many of them and bored still <a name="page93" id="page93" ></a><span class="pagenum">93</span>more. Some, indeed, wanted
to maul him and kick him out, but the advice of the more sober
spirits and the threats of others persuaded him to cut short his
ill-timed lecture. The Vestal Virgins, too, came in procession to
bring Antonius a letter from Vitellius, in which he demanded one
day's postponement of the final crisis, saying that everything could
easily be settled, if only they would grant this respite. Antonius
sent the Virgins away with all respect, and wrote in answer to
Vitellius that the murder of Sabinus and the burning of the Capitol
had broken off all negotiations. <a name="IIIchap82" id="IIIchap82"></a><span class="chapnum">82</span>However, he summoned the
legions to a meeting and endeavoured to mollify them, proposing that
they should pitch their camp near the Mulvian Bridge and enter the
city on the following day. His motive for delay was a fear that the
troops, when once their blood was up after a skirmish, would have no
respect for civilians or senators, or even for the temples and
shrines of the gods. But they suspected every postponement as a
hindrance to their victory. Moreover, some colours which were seen
glittering along the hills, gave the impression of a hostile force,
although none but peaceful citizens accompanied them.</p>

<p>The attack was made in three columns. One advanced from its original
position on the Flaminian road, one kept near the bank of the Tiber,
and the third approached the Colline Gate along the Salarian road.
The cavalry rode into the mob and scattered them. But the Vitellian
troops faced the enemy, themselves, too, in three separate
divisions. Again <a name="page94" id="page94" ></a><span class="pagenum">94</span>and again they engaged before the walls with
varying success. But the Flavians had the advantage of being well
led and thus more often won success. Only one of the attacking
parties suffered at all severely, that which had made its way along
narrow, greasy lanes to Sallust's <a name="fnm219" id="fnm219"></a>Gardens<a href="#fn219" class="fnnum">219</a> on the left side of
the city. Standing on the garden walls, the Vitellians hurled stones
and javelins down upon them and held them back until late in the
day. But at last the cavalry forced an entrance by the Colline Gate
and took the defenders in the rear. Then the opposing forces met on
the Martian Plain itself. Fortune favoured the Flavians and the
sense of victories won. The Vitellians charged in sheer despair,
but, though driven back, they gathered again in the city.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap83" id="IIIchap83"></a><span class="chapnum">83</span>The people came and watched the fighting, cheering and
applauding now one side, now the other, like spectators at a
gladiatorial contest. Whenever one side gave ground, and the
soldiers began to hide in shops or seek refuge in some private
house, they clamoured for them to be dragged out and killed, and
thus got the greater part of the plunder for themselves: for while
the soldiers were busy with the bloody work of massacre, the spoil
fell to the crowd. The scene throughout the city was hideous and
terrible: on the one side fighting and wounded men, on the other
baths and restaurants: here lay heaps of bleeding dead, and close at
hand were harlots and their companions&mdash;all the vice and licence of
luxurious peace, <a name="page95" id="page95" ></a><span class="pagenum">95</span>and all the crime and horror of a captured town.
One might well have thought the city mad with fury and mad with
pleasure at the same time. Armies had fought in the city before
this, twice when Sulla mastered <a name="fnm220" id="fnm220"></a>Rome,<a href="#fn220" class="fnnum">220</a> once under <a name="fnm221" id="fnm221"></a>Cinna.<a href="#fn221" class="fnnum">221</a>
Nor were there less horrors then. What was now so inhuman was the
people's indifference. Not for one minute did they interrupt the
life of pleasure. The fighting was a new amusement for their
holiday.<a name="fnm222" id="fnm222"></a><a href="#fn222" class="fnnum">222</a> Caring nothing for either party, they enjoyed
themselves in riotous dissipation and took a frank pleasure in their
country's disaster.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap84" id="IIIchap84"></a><span class="chapnum">84</span>The storming of the Guards' camp was the most troublesome
task. It was still held by some of the bravest as a forlorn hope,
which made the victors all the more eager to take it, especially
those who had originally served in the Guards. They employed against
it every means ever devised for the storming of the most strongly
fortified towns, a 'tortoise',<a name="fnm223" id="fnm223"></a><a href="#fn223" class="fnnum">223</a> artillery, earthworks,
firebrands. This, they cried, was the crown of all the toil and
danger they had undergone in all their battles. They had restored
the city to the senate and people of Rome, and their Temples to the
gods: the soldier's pride is his camp, it is his country and his
home. If they could not regain it at once, they must spend the night
in fighting. The Vitellians, for their part, had numbers and fortune
against them, but by marring their enemy's victory, by postponing
<a name="page96" id="page96" ></a><span class="pagenum">96</span>peace, by fouling houses and altars with their blood, they embraced
the last consolations that the conquered can enjoy. Many lay more
dead than alive on the towers and ramparts of the walls and there
expired. When the gates were torn down, the remainder faced the
conquerors in a body. And there they fell, every man of them facing
the enemy with all his wounds in front. Even as they died they took
care to make an honourable end.</p>

<p>When the city was taken, Vitellius left the Palace by a back way and
was carried in a litter to his wife's house on the Aventine. If he
could lie hid during the day, he hoped to make his escape to his
brother and the Guards at Tarracina. But it is in the very nature of
terror that, while any course looks dangerous, the present state of
things seems worst of all. His fickle determination soon changed and
he returned to the vast, deserted Palace, whence even the lowest of
his menials had fled, or at least avoided meeting him. Shuddering at
the solitude and hushed silence of the place, he wandered about,
trying closed doors, terrified to find the rooms empty; until at
last, wearied with his miserable search, he crept into some shameful
hiding-place. There Julius Placidus, an officer of the Guards, found
him and dragged him out. His hands were tied behind his back, his
clothes were torn, and thus he was led forth&mdash;a loathly spectacle at
which many hurled insults and no one shed a single tear of pity. The
ignominy of his end killed all compassion. On the way a soldier of
the German army either <a name="page97" id="page97" ></a><span class="pagenum">97</span>aimed an angry blow at him, or tried to put
him out of his shame, or meant, perhaps, to strike the officer in
command; at any rate, he cut off the officer's ear and was
immediately stabbed. <a name="IIIchap85" id="IIIchap85"></a><span class="chapnum">85</span>With the points of their swords they
made Vitellius hold up his head and face their insults, forcing him
again and again to watch his own statues hurtling down, or to look
at the Rostra and the spot where Galba had been killed. At last he
was dragged along to the Ladder of <a name="fnm224" id="fnm224"></a>Sighs,<a href="#fn224" class="fnnum">224</a> where the body of
Flavius Sabinus had lain. One saying of his which was recorded had a
ring of true nobility. When some officer flung reproaches at him, he
answered, 'And yet I was once your emperor.' After that he fell
under a shower of wounds, and when he was dead the mob abused him as
loudly as they had flattered him in his lifetime&mdash;and with as little
reason.</p>

<p><a name="IIIchap86" id="IIIchap86"></a><span class="chapnum">86</span>Vitellius' home was at <a name="fnm225" id="fnm225"></a>Luceria.<a href="#fn225" class="fnnum">225</a> He was in his
fifty-seventh year, and had won the consulship, priesthoods, and a
name and position among Rome's greatest men, all of which he owed to
no efforts of his own, but solely to his father's <a name="fnm226" id="fnm226"></a>eminence.<a href="#fn226" class="fnnum">226</a>
Those who offered him the throne had not yet learnt to know him; and
yet his slothful cowardice won from his soldiers an enthusiasm which
the best of generals have rarely evoked. Still he had the qualities
of candour and generosity, which without moderation are <a name="page98" id="page98" ></a><span class="pagenum">98</span>liable to
prove disastrous. He had few friends, though he bought many,
thinking to keep them, not by showing moral stamina, but by giving
liberal presents. It was indubitably good for the country that
Vitellius should be beaten. But those who betrayed him to Vespasian
can hardly make a merit of their perfidy, for they were the very men
who had deserted Galba for Vitellius.</p>

<p>The day was already sinking into evening. The magistrates and
senators had fled in terror from the city, or were still in hiding
at dependants' houses: it was therefore impossible to call a meeting
of the senate. When all fear of violence was at an end, Domitian
came <a name="fnm227" id="fnm227"></a>out<a href="#fn227" class="fnnum">227</a> and presented himself to the generals of his party.
The crowds of soldiers at once hailed him as Caesar, and marched
off, still in full armour, to escort him to his father's house.</p>

<h3><a name="Rome_after" id="Rome_after"></a>Rome after the Fall of Vitellius</h3>

<p class="center">(January-July, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 70)</p>


<p class="gaplet"><a name="IVchap1" id="IVchap1"></a><span class="chapnum">1</span>The death of Vitellius ended the war without inaugurating
peace. The victors remained under arms, and the defeated Vitellians
were hunted through the city with implacable hatred, and butchered
promiscuously wherever they were found. The streets were choked with
corpses; squares and temples ran with blood. Soon the riot knew no
restraint; they began to hunt for those who were in hiding and to
drag them out. All who were tall and of youthful appearance, whether
soldiers or civilians, were cut down <a name="fnm228" id="fnm228"></a>indiscriminately.<a href="#fn228" class="fnnum">228</a> While
their rage was fresh they sated their savage cravings with blood;
then suddenly the instinct of greed prevailed. On the pretext of
hunting for hidden enemies, they would leave no door unopened and
regard no privacy. Thus they began to rifle private houses or else
made resistance an excuse for murder. There were plenty of needy
citizens, too, and of rascally slaves, who were perfectly ready to
betray wealthy householders: others were indicated by their friends.
From all sides came cries of mourning <a name="page100" id="page100" ></a><span class="pagenum">100</span>and misery. Rome was like a
captured city. People even longed to have the insolent soldiery of
Otho and Vitellius back again, much as they had been hated. The
Flavian generals, who had fanned the flame of civil war with such
energy, were incapable of using their victory temperately. In riot
and disorder the worst characters take the lead; peace and quiet
call for the highest qualities.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap2" id="IVchap2"></a><span class="chapnum">2</span>Domitian having secured the title and the official residence
of a <a name="fnm229" id="fnm229"></a>Caesar,<a href="#fn229" class="fnnum">229</a> did not as yet busy himself with serious matters,
but in his character of emperor's son devoted himself to dissolute
intrigues. Arrius <a name="fnm230" id="fnm230"></a>Varus<a href="#fn230" class="fnnum">230</a> took command of the Guards, but the
supreme authority rested with Antonius Primus. He removed money and
slaves from the emperor's house as though he were plundering
Cremona. The other generals, from excess of modesty or lack of
spirit, shared neither the distinctions of the war nor the profits
of peace.</p>

<p>People in Rome were now so nervous and so resigned to despotism that
they demanded that Lucius Vitellius and his force of Guards should
be surprised on their way back from <a name="fnm231" id="fnm231"></a>Tarracina,<a href="#fn231" class="fnnum">231</a> and the last
sparks of the war stamped out. Some cavalry were sent forward to
Aricia, while the column of the legions halted short of
Bovillae.<a name="fnm232" id="fnm232"></a><a href="#fn232" class="fnnum">232</a> Vitellius, however, lost no time in surrendering
himself and his Guards to the conqueror's <a name="page101" id="page101" ></a><span class="pagenum">101</span>discretion, and the men
flung away their unlucky swords more in anger than in fear. The long
line of prisoners filed through the city between ranks of armed
guards. None looked like begging for mercy. With sad, set faces they
remained sternly indifferent to the applause or the mockery of the
ribald crowd. A few tried to break away, but were surrounded and
overpowered. The rest were put in prison. Not one of them gave vent
to any unseemly complaint. Through all their misfortunes they
preserved their reputation for courage. Lucius Vitellius was then
executed. He was as weak as his brother, though during the
principate he showed himself less indolent. Without sharing his
brother's success, he was carried away on the flood of his disaster.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap3" id="IVchap3"></a><span class="chapnum">3</span>At this time Lucilius <a name="fnm233" id="fnm233"></a>Bassus<a href="#fn233" class="fnnum">233</a> was sent off with a force
of light horse to quell the disquiet in Campania, which was caused
more by the mutual jealousy of the townships than by any opposition
to the emperor. The sight of the soldiers restored order. The
smaller colonies were pardoned, but at Capua the Third <a name="fnm234" id="fnm234"></a>legion<a href="#fn234" class="fnnum">234</a>
was left in winter quarters and some of the leading families
fined.<a name="fnm235" id="fnm235"></a><a href="#fn235" class="fnnum">235</a> Tarracina, on the other hand, received no relief. It is
always easier to requite an injury than a service: gratitude is a
burden, but revenge is found to pay. Their only consolation was that
one of Vergilius Capito's slaves, who had, as we <a name="page102" id="page102" ></a><span class="pagenum">102</span>have <a name="fnm236" id="fnm236"></a>seen,<a href="#fn236" class="fnnum">236</a>
betrayed the town, was hanged on the gallows with the very
<a name="fnm237" id="fnm237"></a>rings<a href="#fn237" class="fnnum">237</a> on his fingers which Vitellius had given him to wear.</p>

<p>At Rome the senate decreed to Vespasian all the usual prerogatives
of the <a name="fnm238" id="fnm238"></a>principate.<a href="#fn238" class="fnnum">238</a> They were now happy and confident. Seeing
that the civil war had broken out in the provinces of Gaul and
Spain, and after causing a rebellion first in Germany and then in
Illyricum, had spread to Egypt, Judaea, <a name="fnm239" id="fnm239"></a>Syria,<a href="#fn239" class="fnnum">239</a> and in fact to
all the provinces and armies of the empire, they felt that the world
had been purged as by fire and that all was now over. Their
satisfaction was still further enhanced by a letter from Vespasian,
which at first sight seemed to be phrased as if the war was still
going on. Still his tone was that of an emperor, though he spoke of
himself as a simple citizen and gave his country all the glory. The
senate for its part showed no lack of deference. They decreed that
Vespasian himself should be consul with Titus for his colleague, and
on Domitian they conferred the praetorship with the powers of a
consul.<a name="fnm240" id="fnm240"></a><a href="#fn240" class="fnnum">240</a></p>

<p><a name="IVchap4" id="IVchap4"></a><span class="chapnum">4</span>Mucianus had also addressed a letter to the senate <a name="page103" id="page103" ></a><span class="pagenum">103</span>which
gave rise to a good deal of <a name="fnm241" id="fnm241"></a>talk.<a href="#fn241" class="fnnum">241</a> If he were a private citizen,
why adopt the official tone? He could have expressed the same
opinions a few days later from his place in the House. Besides, his
attack on Vitellius came too late to prove his independence, and
what seemed particularly humiliating for the country and insulting
to the emperor was his boast that he had held the empire in the
hollow of his hand, and had given it to Vespasian. However, they
concealed their ill-will and made a great show of flattery,
decreeing to Mucianus in the most complimentary terms full triumphal
honours, which were really given him for his success against his
fellow countrymen, though they trumped up an expedition to Sarmatia
as a <a name="fnm242" id="fnm242"></a>pretext.<a href="#fn242" class="fnnum">242</a> On Antonius Primus they conferred the insignia of
the consulship, and those of the praetorship on Cornelius Fuscus and
Arrius Varus. Then came the turn of the gods: it was decided to
restore the Capitol. These proposals were all moved by the
consul-designate, Valerius <a name="fnm243" id="fnm243"></a>Asiaticus.<a href="#fn243" class="fnnum">243</a> The others signified
assent by smiling and holding up their hands, though a few, who were
particularly distinguished, or especially practised in the art of
flattery, delivered set speeches. When it came to the turn of
Helvidius Priscus, the praetor-designate, he expressed himself in
terms which, while doing honour to a good emperor, were perfectly
frank <a name="page104" id="page104" ></a><span class="pagenum">104</span>and <a name="fnm244" id="fnm244"></a>honest.<a href="#fn244" class="fnnum">244</a> The senate showed their keen approval, and
it was this day which first won for him great disfavour and great
distinction.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap5" id="IVchap5"></a><span class="chapnum">5</span>Since I have had occasion to make a second <a name="fnm245" id="fnm245"></a>allusion<a href="#fn245" class="fnnum">245</a> to
a man whom I shall often have to mention <a name="fnm246" id="fnm246"></a>again,<a href="#fn246" class="fnnum">246</a> it may be well
to give here a brief account of his character and ideals, and of his
fortune in life. Helvidius Priscus came from the country town of
Cluviae.<a name="fnm247" id="fnm247"></a><a href="#fn247" class="fnnum">247</a> His father had been a senior centurion in the army.
From his early youth Helvidius devoted his great intellectual powers
to the higher studies, not as many people do, with the idea of using
a philosopher's reputation as a cloak for <a name="fnm248" id="fnm248"></a>indolence,<a href="#fn248" class="fnnum">248</a> but rather
to fortify himself against the caprice of fortune when he entered
public life. He became a follower of that school of <a name="fnm249" id="fnm249"></a>philosophy<a href="#fn249" class="fnnum">249</a>
which holds that honesty is the one good thing in life and sin the
only evil, while power and rank and other such external things, not
being qualities of character, are neither good nor bad. He had risen
no higher than the rank of quaestor when Paetus Thrasea chose him
for his son-in-law,<a name="fnm250" id="fnm250"></a><a href="#fn250" class="fnnum">250</a> and of Thrasea's virtues he absorbed none
so much as his independence. As citizen, senator, husband,
son-in-law, friend, in every sphere of life he was thoroughly
consistent, always showing contempt <a name="page105" id="page105" ></a><span class="pagenum">105</span>for money, stubborn persistence
in the right, and courage in the face of danger. <a name="IVchap6" id="IVchap6"></a><span class="chapnum">6</span>Some people
thought him too ambitious, for even with philosophers the passion
for fame is often their last rag of infirmity. After Thrasea's fall
Helvidius was banished, but he returned to Rome under Galba and
proceeded to prosecute Eprius <a name="fnm251" id="fnm251"></a>Marcellus,<a href="#fn251" class="fnnum">251</a> who had informed
against his father-in-law. This attempt to secure a revenge, as bold
as it was just, divided the senate into two parties, for the fall of
Marcellus would involve the ruin of a whole army of similar
offenders. At first the struggle was full of recrimination, as the
famous speeches on either side testify; but after a while, finding
that Galba's attitude was doubtful and that many of the senators
begged him to desist, Helvidius dropped the prosecution. On his
action in this matter men's comments varied with their character,
some praising his moderation, others asking what had become of his
tenacity.</p>

<p>To return to the senate: at the same meeting at which they voted
powers to Vespasian they also decided to send a deputation to
address him. This gave rise to a sharp dispute between Helvidius
Priscus and Eprius Marcellus. The former thought the members of the
deputation ought to be nominated by magistrates acting under oath;
Marcellus demanded their selection by lot. The consul-designate had
already spoken in <a name="IVchap7" id="IVchap7"></a><span class="chapnum">7</span>favour of the latter method, but
Marcellus' motive was personal vanity, for he was afraid that if
others <a name="page106" id="page106" ></a><span class="pagenum">106</span>were chosen he would seem slighted. Their exchange of views
gradually grew into a formal and acrimonious debate. Helvidius
inquired why it was that Marcellus was so afraid of the magistrates'
judgement, seeing that he himself had great advantages of wealth and
of eloquence over many others. Could it be the memory of his
misdeeds that so oppressed him? The fall of the lot could not
discern character: but the whole point of submitting people to the
vote and to scrutiny by the senate was to get at the truth about
each man's life and reputation. In the interest of the country, and
out of respect to Vespasian, it was important that he should be met
by men whom the senate considered beyond reproach, men who would
give the emperor a taste for honest language. Vespasian had been a
friend of Thrasea, Soranus, and <a name="fnm252" id="fnm252"></a>Sentius,<a href="#fn252" class="fnnum">252</a> and even though there
might be no need to punish their prosecutors, still it would be
wrong to put them forward. Moreover, the senate's selection would be
a sort of hint to the emperor whom to approve and whom to avoid.
'Good friends are the most effective instruments of good government.
Marcellus ought to be content with having driven Nero to destroy so
many innocent people. Let him enjoy the impunity and the profit he
has won from that, and leave Vespasian to more honest advisers.'</p>

<p><a name="page107" id="page107" ></a><span class="pagenum">107</span><a name="IVchap8" id="IVchap8"></a><span class="chapnum">8</span>Marcellus replied that the opinion which was being impugned
was not his own. The consul-designate had already advised them to
follow the established precedent, which was that deputations should
be chosen by lot, so that there should be no room for intrigue or
personal animosity. Nothing had happened to justify them in setting
aside such an ancient system. Why turn a compliment to the emperor
into a slight upon some one else? Anybody could do homage. What they
had to avoid was the possibility that some people's obstinacy might
irritate the emperor at the outset of his reign, while his
intentions were undecided and he was still busy watching faces and
listening to what was said. 'I have not forgotten,' he went on, 'the
days of my youth or the constitution which our fathers and
grandfathers <a name="fnm253" id="fnm253"></a>established.<a href="#fn253" class="fnnum">253</a> But while admiring a distant past, I
support the existing state of things. I pray for good emperors, but
I take them as they come. As for Thrasea, it was not my speech but
the senate's verdict which did for him. Nero took a savage delight
in farces like that trial, and, really, the friendship of such an
emperor cost me as much anxiety as banishment did to others. In
fine, Helvidius may be as brave and as firm as any Brutus or Cato; I
am but a senator and we are all slaves together. Besides, I advise
my friend not to try and get an upper hand with our emperor or to
force his tuition on a man of ripe <a name="fnm254" id="fnm254"></a>years,<a href="#fn254" class="fnnum">254</a> who wears the
insignia of a triumph and is the father <a name="page108" id="page108" ></a><span class="pagenum">108</span>of two grown sons. Bad
rulers like absolute sovereignty, and even the best of them must set
some limit to their subjects' independence.'</p>

<p>This heated interchange of arguments found supporters for both
views. The party which wanted the deputies chosen by lot eventually
prevailed, since even the moderates were anxious to observe the
precedent, and all the most prominent members tended to vote with
them, for fear of encountering ill-feeling if they were selected.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap9" id="IVchap9"></a><span class="chapnum">9</span>This dispute was followed by another. The Praetors, who in
those days administered the <a name="fnm255" id="fnm255"></a>Treasury,<a href="#fn255" class="fnnum">255</a> complained of the spread
of poverty in the country and demanded some restriction of
expenditure. The consul-designate said that, as the undertaking
would be so vast and the remedy so difficult, he was in favour of
leaving it for the emperor. Helvidius maintained that it ought to be
settled by the senate's decision. When the consuls began to take
each senator's opinion, Vulcacius Tertullinus, one of the tribunes,
interposed his veto, on the ground that they could not decide such
an important question in the emperor's absence. Helvidius had
previously moved that the Capitol should be restored at the public
cost, and with the assistance of Vespasian. The moderates all passed
over this suggestion in silence and soon <a name="page109" id="page109" ></a><span class="pagenum">109</span>forgot it, but there were
others who took care to remember <a name="fnm256" id="fnm256"></a>it.<a href="#fn256" class="fnnum">256</a></p>

<p><a name="IVchap10" id="IVchap10"></a><span class="chapnum">10</span>It was at this time that Musonius <a name="fnm257" id="fnm257"></a>Rufus<a href="#fn257" class="fnnum">257</a> brought an
action against Publius Celer on the ground that it was only by
perjury that he had secured the conviction of Soranus <a name="fnm258" id="fnm258"></a>Barea.<a href="#fn258" class="fnnum">258</a> It
was felt that this trial restarted the hue and cry against
professional accusers. But the defendant was a rascal of no
importance who could not be sheltered, and, moreover, Barea's memory
was sacred. Celer had set up as a teacher of philosophy and then
committed perjury against his pupil Barea, thus treacherously
violating the very principles of friendship which he professed to
teach. The case was put down for the next day's <a name="fnm259" id="fnm259"></a>meeting.<a href="#fn259" class="fnnum">259</a> But
now that a taste for revenge was aroused, people were all agog to
see not so much Musonius and Publius as Priscus and Marcellus and
the rest in court.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap11" id="IVchap11"></a><span class="chapnum">11</span>Thus the senate quarrelled; the defeated party nursed their
grievances; the winners had no power to enforce their will; law was
in abeyance and the emperor absent. This state of things continued
until Mucianus arrived in Rome and took everything into his own
hands. This shattered the supremacy of Antonius and Varus, for,
though Mucianus tried to show a friendly face towards them, he was
not very <a name="page110" id="page110" ></a><span class="pagenum">110</span>successful in concealing his dislike. But the people of
Rome, having acquired great skill in detecting strained relations,
had already transferred their allegiance. Mucianus was now the sole
object of their flattering attentions. And he lived up to them. He
surrounded himself with an armed escort, and kept changing his house
and gardens. His display, his public appearances, the night-watch
that guarded him, all showed that he had adopted the style of an
emperor while forgoing the title. The greatest alarm was aroused by
his execution of Calpurnius Galerianus, a son of Caius <a name="fnm260" id="fnm260"></a>Piso.<a href="#fn260" class="fnnum">260</a> He
had attempted no treachery, but his distinguished name and handsome
presence had made the youth a subject of common talk, and the
country was full of turbulent spirits who delighted in revolutionary
rumours and idly talked of his coming to the throne. Mucianus gave
orders that he should be arrested by a body of soldiers, and to
avoid a conspicuous execution in the heart of the city, they marched
him forty miles along the Appian road, where they severed his veins
and let him bleed to death. Julius Priscus, who had commanded the
Guards under Vitellius, committed suicide, more from shame than of
necessity. Alfenus Varus survived the disgrace of his
cowardice.<a name="fnm261" id="fnm261"></a><a href="#fn261" class="fnnum">261</a> <a name="fnm262" id="fnm262"></a>Asiaticus,<a href="#fn262" class="fnnum">262</a> who was a freedman, paid for his
malign influence by dying the death of a <a name="fnm263" id="fnm263"></a>slave.<a href="#fn263" class="fnnum">263</a></p>

<h3><a name="The_Revolt" id="The_Revolt"></a>The Revolt of Civilis and the Batavi</h3>

<p><a name="IVchap12" id="IVchap12"></a><span class="chapnum">12</span>The growing rumour of a reverse in <a name="fnm264" id="fnm264"></a>Germany<a href="#fn264" class="fnnum">264</a> had not as
yet caused any alarm in Rome. People alluded to the loss of armies,
the capture of the legions' winter quarters, the defection of the
Gallic provinces as matters of indifference. I must now go back and
explain the origin of this war, and of the widespread rebellion of
foreign and allied tribes which now broke into flame.</p>

<p>The Batavi were once a tribe of the <a name="fnm265" id="fnm265"></a>Chatti,<a href="#fn265" class="fnnum">265</a> living on the
further bank of the Rhine. But an outbreak of civil war had driven
them across the river, where they settled in a still unoccupied
district on the frontier of Gaul and also in the neighbouring
island, enclosed on one side by the ocean and on the other three
sides by the <a name="fnm266" id="fnm266"></a>Rhine.<a href="#fn266" class="fnnum">266</a> There they fared better than most tribes
who ally themselves to a stronger power. Their resources are still
intact, and they have only to contribute men and arms for the
imperial <a name="fnm267" id="fnm267"></a>army.<a href="#fn267" class="fnnum">267</a> After <a name="page112" id="page112" ></a><span class="pagenum">112</span>a long training in the German wars, they
still further increased their reputation in Britain, where their
troops had been sent, commanded according to an ancient custom by
some of the noblest chiefs. There still remained behind in their own
country a picked troop of horsemen with a peculiar knack of
swimming, which enabled them to make a <a name="fnm268" id="fnm268"></a>practice<a href="#fn268" class="fnnum">268</a> of crossing the
Rhine with unbroken ranks without losing control of their horses or
their weapons.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap13" id="IVchap13"></a><span class="chapnum">13</span>Of their chieftains two outshone the rest. These were
Julius Paulus and Julius Civilis, both of royal stock. Paulus had
been executed by Fonteius Capito on a false charge of
rebellion.<a name="fnm269" id="fnm269"></a><a href="#fn269" class="fnnum">269</a> On the same occasion Civilis was sent in chains to
Nero. Galba, however, set him free, and under Vitellius he again ran
great risk of his life, when the army clamoured for his
execution.<a name="fnm270" id="fnm270"></a><a href="#fn270" class="fnnum">270</a> This gave him a motive for hating Rome, and our
misfortunes fed his hopes. He was, indeed, far cleverer than most
barbarians, and professed to be a second Sertorius or Hannibal,
because they all three had the same physical <a name="fnm271" id="fnm271"></a>defect.<a href="#fn271" class="fnnum">271</a> He was
afraid that if he openly rebelled against the Roman people they
would treat him as an enemy, and march on him at once, so he
pretended to be a keen supporter of Vespasian's party. This much was
true, that Antonius<a name="page113" id="page113" ></a><span class="pagenum">113</span> Primus had written instructing him to divert
the auxiliaries whom Vitellius had summoned, and to delay the
legions on the pretence of a rising in Germany. Moreover, Hordeonius
<a name="fnm272" id="fnm272"></a>Flaccus<a href="#fn272" class="fnnum">272</a> had given him the same advice in person, for Flaccus
was inclined to support Vespasian and anxious for the safety of
Rome, which was threatened with utter disaster, if the war were to
break out afresh and all these thousands of troops come pouring into
Italy.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap14" id="IVchap14"></a><span class="chapnum">14</span>Having thus made up his mind to rebel, Civilis concealed in
the meantime his ulterior design, and while intending to guide his
ultimate policy by future events, proceeded to initiate the rising
as follows. The young Batavians were by Vitellius' orders being
pressed for service, and this burden was being rendered even more
irksome than it need have been by the greed and depravity of the
recruiting officers. They took to enrolling elderly men and invalids
so as to get bribes for excusing them: or, as most of the Batavi are
tall and good-looking in their youth, they would seize the
handsomest boys for immoral purposes. This caused bad feeling; an
agitation was organized, and they were persuaded to refuse service.
Accordingly, on the pretext of giving a banquet, Civilis summoned
the chief nobles and the most determined of the tribesmen to a
sacred grove. Then, when he saw them excited by their revelry and
the late hour of the night, he began to speak of the glorious past
of the Batavi and to enumerate the wrongs they had suffered, the
injustice <a name="page114" id="page114" ></a><span class="pagenum">114</span>and extortion and all the evils of their slavery. 'We are
no longer treated,' he said, 'as we used to be, like allies, but
like menials and slaves. Why, we are never even visited by an
imperial <a name="fnm273" id="fnm273"></a>Governor<a href="#fn273" class="fnnum">273</a>&mdash;irksome though the insolence of his staff
would be. We are given over to prefects and centurions; and when
these subordinates have had their fill of extortion and of
bloodshed, they promptly find some one to replace them, and then
there are new pockets to fill and new pretexts for plunder. Now
conscription is upon us: children are to be torn from parents,
brother from brother, never, probably, to meet again. And yet the
fortunes of Rome were never more depressed. Their cantonments
contain nothing but loot and a lot of old men. Lift up your eyes and
look at them. There is nothing to fear from legions that only exist
on <a name="fnm274" id="fnm274"></a>paper.<a href="#fn274" class="fnnum">274</a> And we are strong. We have infantry and cavalry: the
Germans are our kinsmen: the Gauls share our ambition. Even the
Romans will be grateful if we go to <a name="fnm275" id="fnm275"></a>war.<a href="#fn275" class="fnnum">275</a> If we fail, we can
claim credit for supporting Vespasian: if we succeed, there will be
no one to call us to account.'</p>

<p><a name="IVchap15" id="IVchap15"></a><span class="chapnum">15</span>His speech was received with great approval, and he at once
bound them all to union, using the barbarous ceremonies and strange
oaths of his country. They <a name="page115" id="page115" ></a><span class="pagenum">115</span>then sent to the Canninefates to join
their enterprise. This tribe inhabits part of the <a name="fnm276" id="fnm276"></a>Island,<a href="#fn276" class="fnnum">276</a> and
though inferior in numbers to the Batavi, they are of the same race
and language and the same courageous spirit. Civilis next sent
secret messages to win over the Batavian troops, which after serving
as Roman auxiliaries in Britain had been sent, as we have already
seen,<a name="fnm277" id="fnm277"></a><a href="#fn277" class="fnnum">277</a> to Germany and were now stationed at <a name="fnm278" id="fnm278"></a>Mainz.<a href="#fn278" class="fnnum">278</a></p>

<p>One of the Canninefates, Brinno by name, was a man of distinguished
family and stubborn courage. His father had often ventured acts of
hostility, and had with complete impunity shown his contempt for
Caligula's farcical <a name="fnm279" id="fnm279"></a>expedition.<a href="#fn279" class="fnnum">279</a> To belong to such a family of
rebels was in itself a recommendation. He was accordingly placed on
a shield, swung up on the shoulders of his friends, and thus elected
leader after the fashion of the tribe. Summoning to his aid the
<a name="fnm280" id="fnm280"></a>Frisii<a href="#fn280" class="fnnum">280</a>&mdash;a tribe from beyond the Rhine&mdash;he fell upon two cohorts
of auxiliaries whose camp lay close to the neighbouring <a name="fnm281" id="fnm281"></a>shore.<a href="#fn281" class="fnnum">281</a>
The attack was unexpected, and the troops, even if they had foreseen
it, were not strong enough to offer resistance: so the camp was
taken and looted. They then fell on the Roman camp-<a name="page116" id="page116" ></a><span class="pagenum">116</span>followers and
traders, who had gone off in all directions as if peace were
assured. Finding the forts now threatened with destruction, the
Roman officers set fire to them, as they had no means of defence.
All the troops with their standards and colours retired in a body to
the upper end of the island, led by Aquilius, a senior centurion.
But they were an army in name only, not in strength, for Vitellius
had withdrawn all the efficient soldiers and had replaced them by a
useless mob, who had been drawn from the neighbouring Nervian and
German villages and were only embarrassed by their <a name="fnm282" id="fnm282"></a>armour.<a href="#fn282" class="fnnum">282</a></p>

<p><a name="IVchap16" id="IVchap16"></a><span class="chapnum">16</span>Civilis thought it best to proceed by guile, and actually
ventured to blame the Roman officers for abandoning the forts. He
could, he told them, with the cohort under his command, suppress the
outbreak of the Canninefates without their assistance: they could
all go back to their winter-quarters. However, it was plain that
some treachery underlay his advice&mdash;it would be easier to crush the
cohorts if they were separated&mdash;and also that Civilis, not Brinno,
was at the head of this war. Evidence of this gradually leaked out,
as the Germans loved war too well to keep <a name="page117" id="page117" ></a><span class="pagenum">117</span>the secret for long.
Finding his artifice unsuccessful, Civilis tried force instead,
forming the Canninefates, Frisii and Batavi into three separate
columns.<a name="fnm283" id="fnm283"></a><a href="#fn283" class="fnnum">283</a> The Roman line faced them in position near the Rhine
bank.<a name="fnm284" id="fnm284"></a><a href="#fn284" class="fnnum">284</a> They had brought their ships there after the burning of
the forts, and these were now turned with their prows towards the
enemy. Soon after the engagement began a Tungrian cohort deserted to
Civilis, and the Romans were so startled by this unexpected
treachery that they were cut to pieces by their allies and their
enemies combined. Similar treachery occurred in the fleet. Some of
the rowers, who were Batavians, feigning clumsiness tried to impede
the sailors and marines in the performance of their functions, and
after a while openly resisted them and turned the ships' sterns
towards the enemy's bank. Finally, they killed the pilots and
centurions who refused to join them, and thus all the twenty-four
ships of the flotilla either deserted to the enemy or were captured
by them.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap17" id="IVchap17"></a><span class="chapnum">17</span>This victory made Civilis immediately famous and proved
subsequently very useful. Having now got the ships and the weapons
which they needed, he and his <a name="page118" id="page118" ></a><span class="pagenum">118</span>followers were enthusiastically
proclaimed as champions of liberty throughout Germany and Gaul. The
German provinces immediately sent envoys with offers of help, while
Civilis endeavoured by diplomacy and by bribery to secure an
alliance with the Gauls. He sent back the auxiliary officers whom he
had taken prisoner, each to his own tribe, and offered the cohorts
the choice of either going home or remaining with him. Those who
remained were given an honourable position in his army: and those
who went home received presents out of the Roman spoil. At the same
time Civilis talked to them confidentially and reminded them of the
miseries they had endured for all these years, in which they had
disguised their wretched slavery under the name of peace. 'The
Batavi,' he would say, 'were excused from taxation, and yet they
have taken arms against the common tyrant. In the first engagement
the Romans were routed and beaten. What if Gaul throws off the yoke?
What forces are there left in Italy? It is with the blood of
provincials that their provinces are won. Don't think of the defeat
of Vindex. Why, it was the Batavian cavalry which trampled on the
Aedui and <a name="fnm285" id="fnm285"></a>Arverni,<a href="#fn285" class="fnnum">285</a> and there were Belgic auxiliaries in
Verginius' force. The truth is that Gaul succumbed to her own
armies. But now we are all united in one party, fortified, moreover,
by the military discipline which prevails in Roman camps:<a name="page119" id="page119" ></a><span class="pagenum">119</span> and we
have on our side the veterans before whom Otho's legions lately bit
the dust. Let Syria and Asia play the slave: the East is used to
tyrants: but there are many still living in Gaul who were born
before the days of <a name="fnm286" id="fnm286"></a>tribute.<a href="#fn286" class="fnnum">286</a> Indeed, it is only the other
<a name="fnm287" id="fnm287"></a>day<a href="#fn287" class="fnnum">287</a> that Quintilius Varus was killed, when slavery was driven
out of Germany, and they brought into the field not the Emperor
Vitellius but Caesar Augustus himself. Why, liberty is the natural
prerogative even of dumb animals: courage is the peculiar attribute
of man. Heaven helps the brave. Come, then, fall upon them while
your hands are free and theirs are tied, while you are fresh and
they are weary. Some of them are for Vespasian, others for
Vitellius; now is your chance to crush both parties at once.'</p>

<p><a name="IVchap18" id="IVchap18"></a><span class="chapnum">18</span>Civilis thus had his eye on Gaul and Germany and aspired,
had his project prospered, to become king of two countries, one
pre-eminent in wealth and the other in military strength.</p>

<h3><a name="The_Mutiny" id="The_Mutiny"></a>The Mutiny of the Batavian Cohorts</h3>

<p>Hordeonius Flaccus at first furthered Civilis' schemes by shutting
his eyes to them. But when messengers kept arriving in panic with
news that a camp had been stormed, cohorts wiped out, and not a
Roman left in the Batavian Island, he instructed<a name="page120" id="page120" ></a><span class="pagenum">120</span> Munius Lupercus,
who commanded the two <a name="fnm288" id="fnm288"></a>legions<a href="#fn288" class="fnnum">288</a> in winter-quarters,<a name="fnm289" id="fnm289"></a><a href="#fn289" class="fnnum">289</a> to march
against the enemy. Lupercus lost no time in crossing the <a name="fnm290" id="fnm290"></a>river,<a href="#fn290" class="fnnum">290</a>
taking the legions whom he had with him, some <a name="fnm291" id="fnm291"></a>Ubii<a href="#fn291" class="fnnum">291</a> who were
close at hand, and the Treviran cavalry who were stationed not far
away. To this force he added a regiment of Batavian cavalry, who,
though their loyalty had long ago succumbed, still concealed the
fact, because they hoped their desertion would fetch a higher price,
if they actually betrayed the Romans on the field. Civilis set the
standards of the defeated <a name="fnm292" id="fnm292"></a>cohorts<a href="#fn292" class="fnnum">292</a> round him in a ring to keep
their fresh honours before the eyes of his men, and to terrify the
enemy by reminding them of their disaster. He also gave orders that
his own mother and sisters and all the wives and small children of
his soldiers should be stationed in the rear to spur them to victory
or shame them if they were <a name="fnm293" id="fnm293"></a>beaten.<a href="#fn293" class="fnnum">293</a> When his line raised their
battle-cry, the men singing and the women shrieking, the legions and
their auxiliaries replied with a comparatively feeble cheer, for
their left wing had been exposed by the desertion of the Batavian
cavalry, who promptly turned against us. However, despite the
confusion, the <a name="page121" id="page121" ></a><span class="pagenum">121</span>legionaries gripped their swords and kept their
places. Then the Ubian and Treviran auxiliaries broke in shameful
flight and went wandering all over the country. The Germans pressed
hard on their heels and meanwhile the legions could make good their
escape into the camp, which was called 'Castra Vetera'.<a name="fnm294" id="fnm294"></a><a href="#fn294" class="fnnum">294</a>
Claudius Labeo, who commanded the Batavian cavalry, had opposed
Civilis as a rival in some petty municipal dispute. Civilis was
afraid that, if he killed him, he might offend his countrymen, while
if he spared him his presence would give rise to dissension; so he
sent him off by sea to the Frisii.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap19" id="IVchap19"></a><span class="chapnum">19</span>It was at this time that the cohorts of Batavians and
Canninefates, on their way to Rome under orders from Vitellius,
received the message which Civilis had sent to <a name="fnm295" id="fnm295"></a>them.<a href="#fn295" class="fnnum">295</a> They
promptly fell into a ferment of unruly insolence and demanded a
special grant as payment for their journey, double pay, and an
increase in the number of their <a name="fnm296" id="fnm296"></a>cavalry.<a href="#fn296" class="fnnum">296</a> Although all these
things had been promised by Vitellius they had no hope of obtaining
them, but wanted an excuse for rebellion. Flaccus made many
concessions, but the only result was that they redoubled their
vigour and demanded what they felt sure he would refuse. Paying no
further heed to him they made for Lower Germany, <a name="page122" id="page122" ></a><span class="pagenum">122</span>to join Civilis.
Flaccus summoned the tribunes and centurions and debated with them
whether he should use force to punish this defiance of authority.
After a while he gave way to his natural cowardice and the fears of
his subordinates, who were distressed by the thought that the
loyalty of the auxiliaries was doubtful and that the legions had
been recruited by a hurried levy. It was decided, therefore, to keep
the soldiers in <a name="fnm297" id="fnm297"></a>camp.<a href="#fn297" class="fnnum">297</a> However, he soon changed his mind when he
found himself criticized by the very men whose advice he had taken.
He now seemed bent on pursuit, and wrote to Herennius Gallus in
command of the First legion, who was holding Bonn, telling him to
bar the path of the Batavians, and promising that he and his army
would follow hard upon their heels. The rebels might certainly have
been crushed had Flaccus and Gallus each advanced their forces from
opposite directions and thus surrounded them. But Flaccus soon gave
up the idea, and wrote another letter to Gallus, warning him to let
the rebels pass undisturbed. This gave rise to a suspicion that the
generals were purposely promoting the war; and all the disasters
which had already occurred or were feared in the future, were
attributed not to the soldiers' inefficiency or the strength of the
enemy, but to the treachery of the generals.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap20" id="IVchap20"></a><span class="chapnum">20</span>On nearing the camp at Bonn, the Batavians sent forward a
messenger to explain their intentions to Herennius Gallus. Against
the Romans, for whom <a name="page123" id="page123" ></a><span class="pagenum">123</span>they had fought so often, they had no wish to
make war: but they were worn out after a long and unprofitable term
of service and wanted to go home and rest. If no one opposed them
they would march peaceably by; but if hostility was offered they
would find a passage at the point of the sword. Gallus hesitated,
but his men induced him to risk an engagement. Three thousand
legionaries, some hastily recruited Belgic auxiliaries, and a mob of
peasants and camp-followers, who were as cowardly in action as they
were boastful before it, came pouring out simultaneously from all
the gates, hoping with their superior numbers to surround the
Batavians. But these were experienced veterans. They formed up into
<a name="fnm298" id="fnm298"></a>columns<a href="#fn298" class="fnnum">298</a> in deep formation that defied assault on front, flank,
or rear. They thus pierced our thinner line. The Belgae giving way,
the legion was driven back and ran in terror to reach the trench and
the gates of the camp. It was there that we suffered the heaviest
losses. The trenches were filled with dead, who were not all killed
by the blows of the enemy, for many were stifled in the press or
perished on each other's swords. The victorious cohorts avoided
Cologne and marched on without attempting any further hostilities.
For the battle at Bonn they continued to excuse themselves. They had
asked for peace, they said, and when peace was persistently refused,
had merely acted in self-defence.</p>

<h3><a name="The_Siege" id="The_Siege"></a>The Siege of Vetera</h3>

<p><a name="IVchap21" id="IVchap21"></a><span class="chapnum">21</span>After the arrival of these veteran cohorts Civilis was now
at the head of a respectable army. But being still uncertain of his
plans, and engaged in reckoning up the Roman forces, he made all who
were with him swear allegiance to Vespasian, and sent envoys to the
two legions, who after their defeat in the former <a name="fnm299" id="fnm299"></a>engagement<a href="#fn299" class="fnnum">299</a>
had retired into Vetera, asking them to take the same oath. The
answer came back that they never followed the advice either of a
traitor or of an enemy: Vitellius was their emperor, and they would
keep their allegiance and their arms for him so long as they had
breath in their bodies. A Batavian deserter need not try to decide
the destiny of Rome; he should rather expect the punishment he
richly deserved. When this was reported to Civilis he flew into a
passion, and called the whole Batavian people to take arms. They
were joined by the Bructeri and <a name="fnm300" id="fnm300"></a>Tencteri,<a href="#fn300" class="fnnum">300</a> and Germany was
summoned to come and share the plunder and the glory.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap22" id="IVchap22"></a><span class="chapnum">22</span>Threatened with this gathering storm, Munius Lupercus and
Numisius Rufus, who were in command of the two legions, proceeded to
strengthen the ramparts and walls. They pulled down the buildings
near the military camp, which had grown into a small town during the
long years of peace, fearing that the <a name="page125" id="page125" ></a><span class="pagenum">125</span>enemy might make use of them.
But they omitted to provide a sufficient store of provisions for the
camp, and authorized the soldiers to make up the deficiency by
looting, with the result that what might have supplied their needs
for a long time was consumed in a few days. Meanwhile Civilis
advanced, himself holding the centre with the flower of the Batavi:
on both banks of the Rhine he massed large bands of Germans to
strike terror into the enemy: the cavalry galloped through the
fields, while the ships were simultaneously moved up the stream.
Here could be seen the colours of veteran Roman cohorts, there the
figures of beasts which the Germans had brought from their woods and
groves, as their tribes do when they go to battle. It seemed both a
civil and a savage war at once; and this strange confusion astounded
the besieged. The hopes of the assailants rose when they saw the
circumference of the ramparts, for there were barely five thousand
Roman soldiers to defend a camp which had been laid out to hold two
legions.<a name="fnm301" id="fnm301"></a><a href="#fn301" class="fnnum">301</a> However, a large number of camp-followers had
collected there on the break-up of peace, and remained to give what
assistance they could to the military operations.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap23" id="IVchap23"></a><span class="chapnum">23</span>The camp was built partly on the gentle slope of a hill and
partly on the level ground. Augustus had believed that it would
serve as a base of operations and a check upon the German tribes: as
for their actually coming to assault our legions, such a disaster
<a name="page126" id="page126" ></a><span class="pagenum">126</span>never occurred to him. Consequently no trouble had been taken in
choosing the site or erecting defences: the strength of the troops
had always seemed sufficient.</p>

<p>The Batavians and the Germans from across the <a name="fnm302" id="fnm302"></a>Rhine<a href="#fn302" class="fnnum">302</a> now formed
up tribe by tribe&mdash;the separation was designed to show their
individual prowess&mdash;and opened fire from a distance. Finding that
most of their missiles fell harmlessly on to the turrets and
pinnacles of the walls, and that they were being wounded by stones
hurled from above, they charged with a wild shout and surged up to
the rampart, some using scaling-ladders, others climbing over their
comrades who had formed a 'tortoise'. But no sooner had some of them
begun to scale the wall, than they were hurled down by the besieged,
who thrust at them with sword and shield, and buried under a shower
of stakes and javelins. The Germans are always impetuous at the
beginning of an action and over-confident when they are winning; and
on this occasion their greed for plunder even steeled them to face
difficulties. They actually attempted to use siege-engines, with
which they were quite unfamiliar. But though they had no skill
themselves, some of the deserters and prisoners showed them how to
build a sort of bridge or platform of timber, on to which they
fitted wheels and rolled it forward. Thus some of them stood on this
platform and fought as though from a mound, while others, concealed
inside, tried to undermine the walls. However, stones hurled from
catapults soon <a name="page127" id="page127" ></a><span class="pagenum">127</span>destroyed this rude engine. Then they began to get
ready hurdles and mantlets, but the besieged shot blazing spears on
to them from engines, and even attacked the assailants themselves
with fire-darts. At last they gave up all hope of an assault and
resolved to try a waiting policy, being well aware that the camp
contained only a few days' provisions and a large number of
non-combatants. They hoped that famine would breed treason, and
counted, besides, on the wavering loyalty of the slaves and the
usual hazards of war to aid them.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap24" id="IVchap24"></a><span class="chapnum">24</span>Meanwhile, <a name="fnm303" id="fnm303"></a>Flaccus,<a href="#fn303" class="fnnum">303</a> who had received news of the siege
of Vetera, dispatched a party to recruit auxiliaries in Gaul, and
gave Dillius Vocula, in command of the Twenty-second, a force of
picked soldiers from his two <a name="fnm304" id="fnm304"></a>legions.<a href="#fn304" class="fnnum">304</a> Vocula was to hurry by
forced marches along the bank of the Rhine, while Flaccus himself
was to approach by water, since he was in bad health and unpopular
with his men. Indeed, they grumbled openly that he had let the
Batavian cohorts get away from Mainz, had connived at Civilis'
schemes, and invited the Germans to join the alliance. Vespasian,
they said, owed his rise more to Flaccus than to all the assistance
of Antonius Primus or of Mucianus, for overt hatred and hostility
can be openly crushed, but treachery and deceit cannot be detected,
much less parried. While Civilis took the field himself and arranged
his own fighting line, Hordeonius lay on a couch in his bedroom and
gave whatever orders <a name="page128" id="page128" ></a><span class="pagenum">128</span>best suited the enemy's convenience. Why
should all these companies of brave soldiers be commanded by one
miserable old invalid? Let them rather kill the traitor and free
their brave hearts and good hopes from the incubus of such an evil
omen. Having worked on each other's feelings by these complaints,
they were still further incensed by the arrival of a letter from
Vespasian. As this could not be concealed, Flaccus read it before a
meeting of the soldiers, and the messengers who brought it were sent
to Vitellius in chains.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap25" id="IVchap25"></a><span class="chapnum">25</span>With feelings thus appeased the army marched on to Bonn,
the head-quarters of the First legion. There the men were still more
indignant with Flaccus, on whom they laid the blame of their recent
defeat.<a name="fnm305" id="fnm305"></a><a href="#fn305" class="fnnum">305</a> It was by his orders, they argued, that they had taken
the field against the Batavians on the understanding that the
legions from Mainz were in pursuit. But no reinforcements had
arrived and his treachery was responsible for their losses. The
facts, moreover, were unknown to the other armies, nor was any
report sent to their emperor, although this treacherous outbreak
could have been nipped in the bud by the combined aid of all the
provinces. In answer Flaccus read out to the army copies of all the
letters which he had sent from time to time all over Gaul and
Britain and Spain to ask for assistance, and introduced the
disastrous practice of having all letters delivered to the
standard-bearers of the legions, who read them to the soldiers
before the general had seen them.<a name="page129" id="page129" ></a><span class="pagenum">129</span> He then gave orders that one of
the mutineers should be put in irons, more by way of vindicating his
authority than because one man was especially to blame. Leaving
Bonn, the army moved on to Cologne, where they were joined by large
numbers of Gallic auxiliaries, who at first zealously supported the
Roman cause: later, when the Germans prospered, most of the tribes
took arms against us, actuated by hopes of liberty and an ambition
to establish an empire of their own when once they had shaken off
the yoke.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the army's indignation steadily increased. The
imprisonment of a single soldier was not enough to terrify them,
and, indeed, the prisoner actually accused the general of complicity
in crime, alleging that he himself had carried messages between
Flaccus and Civilis. 'It is because I can testify to the truth,' he
said, 'that Flaccus wants to get rid of me on a false charge.'
Thereupon Vocula, with admirable self-possession, mounted the
tribunal and, in spite of the man's protestations, ordered him to be
seized and led away to prison. This alarmed the disaffected, while
the better sort obeyed him promptly. The army then unanimously
demanded that Vocula should lead them, and Flaccus accordingly
resigned the chief command to him. <a name="IVchap26" id="IVchap26"></a><span class="chapnum">26</span>However, there was much
to exasperate their disaffection. They were short both of pay and of
provisions: the Gauls refused either to enlist or to pay tribute:
drought, usually unknown in that climate, made the Rhine almost too
low for navigation, and thus hampered their commissariat: patrols
had <a name="page130" id="page130" ></a><span class="pagenum">130</span>to be posted at intervals all along the bank to prevent the
Germans fording the river: and in consequence of all this they had
less food and more mouths to eat it. To the ignorant the lowness of
the river seemed in itself an evil omen, as though the ancient
bulwarks of the empire were now failing them. In peace they would
have called it bad luck or the course of nature: now it was 'fate'
and 'the anger of heaven'.</p>

<p>On entering <a name="fnm306" id="fnm306"></a>Novaesium<a href="#fn306" class="fnnum">306</a> they were joined by the Sixteenth legion.
Herennius <a name="fnm307" id="fnm307"></a>Gallus<a href="#fn307" class="fnnum">307</a> now shared with Vocula the responsibility of
command. As they could not venture out against the enemy, they
encamped ... at a place called <a name="fnm308" id="fnm308"></a>Gelduba,<a href="#fn308" class="fnnum">308</a> where the soldiers were
trained in deploying, in fortification and entrenchment, and in
various other military man&oelig;uvres. To inspire their courage with
the further incentive of plunder, Vocula led out part of the force
against the neighbouring tribe of the <a name="fnm309" id="fnm309"></a>Cugerni,<a href="#fn309" class="fnnum">309</a> who had accepted
Civilis' offers of alliance. The rest of the troops were left behind
with Herennius <a name="fnm310" id="fnm310"></a>Gallus,<a href="#fn310" class="fnnum">310</a> <a name="IVchap27" id="IVchap27"></a><span class="chapnum">27</span>and it happened that a
corn-ship with a full cargo, which had run aground close to the
camp, was towed over by the Germans to their own bank. This was more
than Gallus could tolerate, so he sent a cohort to the rescue. The
number of the Germans soon in<a name="page131" id="page131" ></a><span class="pagenum">131</span>creased: both sides gradually gathered
reinforcements and a regular battle was fought, with the result that
the Germans towed off the ship, inflicting heavy losses. The
defeated troops followed what had now become their regular custom,
and threw the blame not on their own inefficiency but on their
commanding-officer's bad faith. They dragged him from his quarters,
tore his uniform and flogged him, bidding him tell them how much he
had got for betraying the army, and who were his accomplices. Then
their indignation recoiled on Hordeonius Flaccus: he was the real
criminal: Gallus was only his tool. At last their threats so
terrified Gallus that he, too, charged Flaccus with treason. He was
put in irons until the arrival of Vocula, who at once set him free,
and on the next day had the ringleaders of the riot executed. The
army showed, indeed, a strange contrast in its equal readiness to
mutiny and to submit to punishment. The common soldiers' loyalty to
Vitellius was beyond <a name="fnm311" id="fnm311"></a>question,<a href="#fn311" class="fnnum">311</a> while the higher ranks inclined
towards Vespasian. Thus we find a succession of outbreaks and
penalties; an alternation of insubordination with obedience to
discipline; for the troops could be punished though not controlled.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap28" id="IVchap28"></a><span class="chapnum">28</span>Meanwhile the whole of Germany was ready to worship
Civilis, sending him vast reinforcements and ratifying the alliance
with hostages from their noblest families. He gave orders that the
country of the Ubii and Treviri was to be laid waste by their
nearest <a name="page132" id="page132" ></a><span class="pagenum">132</span>neighbours, and sent another party across the Maas to
harass the Menapii and <a name="fnm312" id="fnm312"></a>Morini<a href="#fn312" class="fnnum">312</a> and other frontier tribes of
Gaul. In both quarters they plundered freely, and were especially
savage towards the Ubii, because they were a tribe of German origin
who had renounced their fatherland and adopted the name of
Agrippinenses.<a name="fnm313" id="fnm313"></a><a href="#fn313" class="fnnum">313</a> A Ubian cohort was cut to pieces at the village
of <a name="fnm314" id="fnm314"></a>Marcodurum,<a href="#fn314" class="fnnum">314</a> where they were off their guard, trusting to
their distance from the Rhine. The Ubii did not take this quietly,
nor hesitate to seek reprisals from the Germans, which they did at
first with impunity. In the end, however, the Germans proved too
much for them, and throughout the war the Ubii were always more
conspicuous for good faith than good fortune. Their collapse
strengthened Civilis' position, and emboldened by success, he now
vigorously pressed on the blockade of the legions at Vetera, and
redoubled his vigilance to prevent any message creeping through from
the relieving army. The Batavians were told off to look after the
engines and siege-works: the Germans, who clamoured for battle, were
sent to demolish the rampart and renew the fight directly they were
beaten off. There were so many of them that their losses mattered
little.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap29" id="IVchap29"></a><span class="chapnum">29</span>Nightfall did not see the end of their task. They built
huge fires of wood all round the ramparts and <a name="page133" id="page133" ></a><span class="pagenum">133</span>sat drinking by them;
then, as the wine warmed their hearts, one by one they dashed into
the fight with blind courage. In the darkness their missiles were
ineffective, but the barbarian troops were clearly visible to the
Romans, and any one whose daring or bright ornaments made him
conspicuous at once became a mark for their aim. At last Civilis saw
their mistake, and gave orders to extinguish the fires and plunge
the whole scene into a confusion of darkness and the din of arms.
Discordant shouts now arose: everything was vague and uncertain: no
one could see to strike or to parry. Wherever a shout was heard,
they would wheel round and lunge in that direction. Valour was
useless: chance and chaos ruled supreme: and the bravest soldier
often fell under a coward's bolt. The Germans fought with blind
fury. The Roman troops were more familiar with danger; they hurled
down iron-clamped stakes and heavy stones with sure effect. Wherever
the sound of some one climbing or the clang of a scaling-ladder
betrayed the presence of the enemy, they thrust them back with their
shields and followed them with a shower of javelins. Many appeared
on top of the walls, and these they stabbed with their short swords.
And so the night wore on. <a name="IVchap30" id="IVchap30"></a><span class="chapnum">30</span>Day dawned upon new methods of
attack. The Batavians had built a wooden tower of two stories and
moved it up to the Head-quarters <a name="fnm315" id="fnm315"></a>Gate,<a href="#fn315" class="fnnum">315</a> which was the most
accessible spot. However, our soldiers, by using strong poles and
hurling wooden beams, soon <a name="page134" id="page134" ></a><span class="pagenum">134</span>battered it to pieces, with great loss
of life to those who were standing on it. While they were still
dismayed at this, we made a sudden and successful sally. Meanwhile
the legionaries, with remarkable skill and ingenuity, invented still
further contrivances. The one which caused most terror was a crane
with a movable arm suspended over their assailants' heads: this arm
was suddenly lowered, snatched up one or more of the enemy into the
air before his fellows' eyes, and, as the heavy end was swung round,
tossed him into the middle of the camp. Civilis now gave up hope of
storming the camp and renewed a leisurely blockade, trying all the
time by messages and offers of reward to undermine the loyalty of
the legions.</p>

<h3><a name="Relief_Vetera" id="Relief_Vetera"></a>The Relief of Vetera</h3>

<p><a name="IVchap31" id="IVchap31"></a><span class="chapnum">31</span>Such was the course of events in Germany up to the date of
the battle of <a name="fnm316" id="fnm316"></a>Cremona.<a href="#fn316" class="fnnum">316</a> News of this arrived by letter from
Antonius Primus, who enclosed a copy of Caecina's <a name="fnm317" id="fnm317"></a>edict,<a href="#fn317" class="fnnum">317</a> and
Alpinius <a name="fnm318" id="fnm318"></a>Montanus,<a href="#fn318" class="fnnum">318</a> who commanded one of the defeated auxiliary
cohorts, came in person to confess that his party had been beaten.
The troops were variously affected by the news. The Gallic
auxiliaries, who had no feelings of affection or dislike to either
party and served without sentiment, <a name="page135" id="page135" ></a><span class="pagenum">135</span>promptly took the advice of
their officers and deserted Vitellius. The veterans hesitated; under
pressure from Flaccus and their officers they eventually took the
oath of allegiance, but it was clear from their faces that their
hearts were not in it, and while repeating the rest of the formula
they boggled at the name of Vespasian, either muttering it under
their breath or more often omitting it altogether. <a name="IVchap32" id="IVchap32"></a><span class="chapnum">32</span>Their
suspicions were further inflamed when Antonius' letter to Civilis
was read out before the meeting; it seemed to address Civilis as a
member of the Flavian party, and to argue hostility to the German
army. The news was next brought to the camp at Gelduba, where it
gave rise to the same comments and the same scenes. Montanus was
sent to carry instructions to Civilis that he was to cease from
hostilities and not to make war on Rome under a false pretext; if it
was to help Vespasian that he had taken arms, he had now achieved
his object. Civilis at first replied in guarded terms. Then, as he
saw that Montanus was an impetuous person who would welcome a
revolution, he began to complain of all the dangers he had endured
in the service of Rome for the last twenty-five years. 'A fine
reward I have received,' he cried, 'for all my labours&mdash;my brother's
execution,<a name="fnm319" id="fnm319"></a><a href="#fn319" class="fnnum">319</a> my own imprisonment,<a href="#fn319" class="fnnum">319</a> and the bloodthirsty
clamours of this army, from which I claim satisfaction by natural
right since they have sought my destruction. As for you Trevirans
and all the rest that have the souls of slaves, what reward do you
hope <a name="page136" id="page136" ></a><span class="pagenum">136</span>to gain for shedding your blood so often in the cause of Rome,
except the thankless task of military service, endless taxation, and
the rods and axes of these capricious tyrants? Look at me! I have
only a single cohort under my command, and yet with the Canninefates
and Batavi, a mere fraction of the Gallic peoples, I am engaged in
destroying their great useless camp and besieging them with famine
and the sword. In short, our venture will either end in freedom or,
if we are beaten, we shall be no worse off than before.' Having thus
inflamed Montanus he told him to take back a milder answer and
dismissed him. On his return Montanus pretended that his errand had
been fruitless, and said nothing about the rest of the interview:
but it soon came to light.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap33" id="IVchap33"></a><span class="chapnum">33</span>Retaining a portion of his force, Civilis sent the veteran
cohorts with the most efficient of the German troops against Vocula
and his <a name="fnm320" id="fnm320"></a>army.<a href="#fn320" class="fnnum">320</a> He gave the command to Julius Maximus and his
nephew Claudius Victor. After rushing the winter-quarters of a
cavalry regiment at <a name="fnm321" id="fnm321"></a>Asciburgium<a href="#fn321" class="fnnum">321</a> on their way, they fell upon
the Roman camp and so completely surprised it that Vocula had no
time to address his army or to form it for battle. The only
precaution he could take in the general panic was to mass the
legionaries in the centre with the auxiliaries scattered on either
flank. Our cavalry charged, but found the enemy in good order ready
to receive them, and came flying back on to their own infantry. What
followed was <a name="page137" id="page137" ></a><span class="pagenum">137</span>more of a massacre than a battle. The Nervian cohorts,
either from panic or treachery, left our flanks exposed; thus the
legions had to bear the brunt. They had already lost their standards
and were being cut down in the trenches, when a fresh reinforcement
suddenly changed the fortune of the fight. Some Basque
auxiliaries,<a name="fnm322" id="fnm322"></a><a href="#fn322" class="fnnum">322</a> originally levied by Galba, who had now been
summoned to the rescue, on nearing the camp heard the sound of
fighting, and while the enemy were occupied, came charging in on
their rear. This caused more consternation than their numbers
warranted, the enemy taking them for the whole Roman force, either
from Novaesium or from Mainz. This mistake encouraged the Roman
troops: their confidence in others brought confidence in themselves.
The best of the Batavians, at least of their infantry, fell. The
cavalry made off with the standards and prisoners taken in the
earlier stage of the battle. Though our losses that day were
numerically larger, they were unimportant, whereas the Germans lost
their best troops.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap34" id="IVchap34"></a><span class="chapnum">34</span>On both sides the generals deserved defeat, and failed to
make good use of their success. Their fault was the same. Had
Civilis furnished the attacking column with more troops, they could
never have been surrounded by such a small force, and having stormed
the camp would have destroyed it. Vocula, on the other <a name="page138" id="page138" ></a><span class="pagenum">138</span>hand, had
not even set scouts to warn him of the enemy's approach, and
consequently no sooner sallied out than he was beaten. Then, when he
had won the victory, he showed great lack of confidence, and wasted
day after day before moving against the enemy. If he had made haste
to follow up his success and struck at the enemy at once, he might
have raised the siege of Vetera at one blow.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Civilis had been playing upon the feelings of the besieged
by pretending that the Romans had been defeated and success had
favoured his arms. The captured standards and colours were carried
round the walls and the prisoners also displayed. One of these did a
famous deed of heroism. Shouting at the top of his voice, he
revealed the truth. The Germans at once struck him dead, which only
served to confirm his information. Soon, too, the besieged saw signs
of harried fields and the smoke of burning farms, and began to
realize that a victorious army was approaching. When he was in sight
of the camp Vocula ordered his men to plant the standards and
construct a trench and rampart round them: they were to deposit all
their baggage there and fight unencumbered. This made them shout at
the general to give them the signal; and they had learnt to use
threats too. Without even taking time to form their line they
started the battle, all tired as they were, and in disorder. Civilis
was ready waiting for them, trusting quite as much to their mistakes
as to the merits of his own men. The Romans fought with varying
fortune. All the most mutinous <a name="page139" id="page139" ></a><span class="pagenum">139</span>proved cowards: some, however,
remembered their recent victory and stuck to their places, cutting
down the enemy, and encouraging themselves and their neighbours.
When the battle was thus renewed, they waved their hands and
signalled to the besieged not to lose their opportunity. These were
watching all that happened from the walls, and now came bursting out
at every gate. It chanced that at this point Civilis' horse fell and
threw him; both armies believed the rumour that he had been wounded
and killed. This caused immense consternation to his army and
immense encouragement to ours. However, Vocula failed to pursue them
when they fled, and merely set about strengthening the rampart and
turrets, apparently in fear of another blockade. His frequent
failure to make use of his victory gives colour to the suspicion
that he preferred <a name="fnm323" id="fnm323"></a>war.<a href="#fn323" class="fnnum">323</a></p>

<p><a name="IVchap35" id="IVchap35"></a><span class="chapnum">35</span>What chiefly distressed our troops was the lack of
supplies. The baggage-train of the legions was sent to Novaesium
with a crowd of non-combatants to fetch provisions thence by land,
the enemy being now masters of the river. The first convoy got
through <a name="page140" id="page140" ></a><span class="pagenum">140</span>safely, while Civilis was recovering from his fall. But
when he heard that a second foraging-party had been sent to
Novaesium under guard of several cohorts, and that they were
proceeding on their way with their arms piled in the wagons as if it
was a time of perfect peace, few keeping to the standards and all
wandering at will, he sent some men forward to hold the bridges and
any places where the road was narrow, and then formed up and
attacked. The battle was fought on a long straggling line, and the
issue was still doubtful when nightfall broke it off. The cohorts
made their way through to Gelduba, where the camp remained as it
was,<a name="fnm324" id="fnm324"></a><a href="#fn324" class="fnnum">324</a> garrisoned by the soldiers who had been left behind there.
It was obvious what dangers the convoy would have to face on the
return journey; they would be heavily laden and had already lost
their nerve. <a name="fnm325" id="fnm325"></a>Vocula<a href="#fn325" class="fnnum">325</a> accordingly added to his force a thousand
picked men from the Fifth and Fifteenth legions who had been at
Vetera during the siege, all tough soldiers with a grievance against
their generals. Against his orders, more than the thousand started
with him, openly complaining on the march that they would not put up
with famine and the treachery of their generals any longer. On the
other hand, those who stayed behind grumbled that they were left to
their fate now that part of the garrison had been removed. Thus
there was a double mutiny, one party <a name="page141" id="page141" ></a><span class="pagenum">141</span>calling Vocula back, the
others refusing to return to camp.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap36" id="IVchap36"></a><span class="chapnum">36</span>Meanwhile Civilis laid siege to Vetera. Vocula retired to
Gelduba, and thence to Novaesium, shortly afterwards winning a
cavalry skirmish just outside Novaesium. The Roman soldiers,
however, alike in success and in failure, were as eager as ever to
make an end of their generals. Now that their numbers were swelled
by the arrival of the detachments from the Fifth and the
<a name="fnm326" id="fnm326"></a>Fifteenth<a href="#fn326" class="fnnum">326</a> they demanded their donative, having learnt that
money had arrived from Vitellius. Without further delay Flaccus gave
it to them in Vespasian's name, and this did more than anything else
to promote mutiny. They indulged in wild dissipation and met every
night in drinking-parties, at which they revived their old grudge
against Hordeonius Flaccus. None of the officers ventured to
interfere with them&mdash;the darkness somehow obscured their sense of
duty&mdash;and at last they dragged Flaccus out of bed and murdered him.
They were preparing to do the same with Vocula, but he narrowly
escaped in the darkness, disguised as a slave. <a name="IVchap37" id="IVchap37"></a><span class="chapnum">37</span>When the
excitement subsided, their fears returned, and they sent letters
round by centurions to all the Gallic communities, asking for
reinforcements and money for the soldiers' pay.</p>

<p>Without a leader a mob is always rash, timorous, and inactive. On
the approach of Civilis they hurriedly snatched up their arms, and
then immediately dropped them and took to flight. Misfortune now
bred disunion, <a name="page142" id="page142" ></a><span class="pagenum">142</span>and the army of the Upper <a name="fnm327" id="fnm327"></a>Rhine<a href="#fn327" class="fnnum">327</a> dissociated
itself from the rest. However, they set up the statues of Vitellius
again in the camp and in the neighbouring Belgic villages, although
by now Vitellius was <a name="fnm328" id="fnm328"></a>dead.<a href="#fn328" class="fnnum">328</a> Soon the soldiers of the First,
Fourth, and Twenty-second repented of their folly and rejoined
Vocula. He made them take a second oath of allegiance to Vespasian
and led them off to raise the siege of Mainz. The besieging army, a
combined force of <a name="fnm329" id="fnm329"></a>Chatti,<a href="#fn329" class="fnnum">329</a> Usipi, and <a name="fnm330" id="fnm330"></a>Mattiaci,<a href="#fn330" class="fnnum">330</a> had already
retired, having got sufficient loot and suffered some loss. Our
troops surprised them while they were scattered along the road, and
immediately attacked. Moreover, the Treviri had built a rampart and
breastwork all along their frontier and fought the Germans again and
again with heavy loss to both sides. Before long, however, they
rebelled, and thus sullied their great services to the Roman people.</p>

masterpiece of improbability', and finds it 'hard to speak calmly of
such a judgement'. He has to confess that a military motive for
Vocula's inaction is hard to find. Tacitus, feeling the same, offers
a merely human motive. Soldiers of fortune often prefer war to final
victory, and in these days the dangers of peace were only equalled
by its ennui. Besides, Tacitus' explanation lends itself to an
epigram which he would doubtless not have exchanged for the tedium
of tactical truth.</p></div>

<h3><a name="Under_Vespasian" id="Under_Vespasian"></a>Rome and the Empire under Vespasian</h3>

<p><a name="IVchap38" id="IVchap38"></a><span class="chapnum">38</span>During these events Vespasian took up his second consulship
and Titus his first, both in <a name="fnm331" id="fnm331"></a>absence.<a href="#fn331" class="fnnum">331</a> Rome was depressed and
beset by manifold anxieties. Apart <a name="page143" id="page143" ></a><span class="pagenum">143</span>from the real miseries of the
moment, it was plunged into a groundless panic on the rumour of a
rebellion in Africa, where Lucius Piso was supposed to be plotting a
revolution. Piso, who was governor of the province, was far from
being a firebrand. But the severity of the winter delayed the
corn-ships, and the common people, accustomed to buy their bread day
by day, whose interest in politics was confined to the corn-supply,
soon began to believe their fears that the coast of Africa was being
blockaded and supplies withheld. The Vitellians, who were still
under the sway of party spirit, fostered this rumour, and even the
victorious party were not entirely displeased at it, for none of
their victories in the civil war had satisfied their greed, and even
foreign wars fell far short of their ambition.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap39" id="IVchap39"></a><span class="chapnum">39</span>On the first of January the senate was convened by the
Urban <a name="fnm332" id="fnm332"></a>Praetor,<a href="#fn332" class="fnnum">332</a> Julius Frontinus, and passed votes of thanks and
congratulation to the generals, armies, and foreign <a name="fnm333" id="fnm333"></a>princes.<a href="#fn333" class="fnnum">333</a>
Tettius <a name="fnm334" id="fnm334"></a>Julianus,<a href="#fn334" class="fnnum">334</a> who had left his legion when it went over to
Vespasian, was deprived of his praetorship, which was conferred upon
Plotius <a name="fnm335" id="fnm335"></a>Grypus.<a href="#fn335" class="fnnum">335</a> <a name="fnm336" id="fnm336"></a>Hormus<a href="#fn336" class="fnnum">336</a> was raised to equestrian rank.
Frontinus then resigned his praetorship and Caesar Domitian
succeeded him. His name now stood at the head of all dispatches and
edicts, but the real authority <a name="page144" id="page144" ></a><span class="pagenum">144</span>lay with Mucianus, although
Domitian, following the promptings of his friends and of his own
desires, frequently asserted his independence. But Mucianus' chief
cause of anxiety lay in Antonius Primus and Arrius Varus. The fame
of their exploits was still fresh; the soldiers worshipped them; and
they were popular in Rome, because they had used no violence off the
field of battle. It was even hinted that Antonius had urged Crassus
<a name="fnm337" id="fnm337"></a>Scribonianus<a href="#fn337" class="fnnum">337</a> to seize the throne. He was a man who owed his
distinction to famous ancestors and to his brother's memory, and
Antonius could promise him adequate support for a conspiracy.
However, Scribonianus refused. He had a terror of all risks, and
would hardly have been seduced even by the certainty of success.
Being unable to crush Antonius openly, Mucianus showered compliments
on him in the senate and embarrassed him with promises, hinting at
the governorship of Nearer Spain, which the departure of Cluvius
<a name="fnm338" id="fnm338"></a>Rufus<a href="#fn338" class="fnnum">338</a> had left vacant. Meanwhile he lavished military commands
on Antonius' friends. Then, having filled his empty head with
ambitious hopes, he destroyed his influence at one stroke by moving
the Seventh <a name="fnm339" id="fnm339"></a>legion,<a href="#fn339" class="fnnum">339</a> which was passionately attached to
Antonius, into winter-quarters. The Third, who were similarly
devoted to Arrius Varus, <a name="page145" id="page145" ></a><span class="pagenum">145</span>were sent back to <a name="fnm340" id="fnm340"></a>Syria,<a href="#fn340" class="fnnum">340</a> and part of
the army was taken out to the war in Germany. Thus, on the removal
of the disturbing factors, the city could resume its normal life
under the old regime of law and civil government.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap40" id="IVchap40"></a><span class="chapnum">40</span>On the day of his first appearance in the senate Domitian
spoke a few moderate sentences regretting the absence of his father
and brother. His behaviour was most proper, and, as his character
was still an unknown quantity, his blushes were taken for signs of
modesty.<a name="fnm341" id="fnm341"></a><a href="#fn341" class="fnnum">341</a> He moved from the chair that all Galba's honours
should be restored, to which Curtius Montanus proposed an amendment
that some respect should also be paid to the memory of Piso. The
senate approved both proposals, though nothing was done about Piso.
Next, various commissions were appointed by lot to restore the
spoils of war to the owners; to examine and affix the bronze tablets
of laws, which in course of time had dropped off the walls; to
revise the list of public holidays, which in these days of flattery
had been disgracefully tampered with; and to introduce some economy
into public expenditure. Tettius Julianus was restored to his
praetorship as soon as it was discovered that he had taken refuge
with Vespasian: but Grypus was allowed to retain his <a name="fnm342" id="fnm342"></a>rank.<a href="#fn342" class="fnnum">342</a> It
was then decided to resume the hearing of the case of<a name="page146" id="page146" ></a><span class="pagenum">146</span> Musonius
Rufus against Publius <a name="fnm343" id="fnm343"></a>Celer<a href="#fn343" class="fnnum">343</a> Publius was convicted and the shade
of Soranus satisfied. This strict verdict made the day memorable in
the annals of Rome, and credit was also due to private enterprise,
for everybody felt that Musonius had done his duty in bringing the
action. On the other hand, Demetrius, a professor of Cynic
philosophy, earned discredit for defending an obvious <a name="fnm344" id="fnm344"></a>criminal<a href="#fn344" class="fnnum">344</a>
more for ostentatious motives than from honest conviction. As for
Publius, courage and fluency alike failed him at the critical
moment. This trial was the signal for further reprisals against
prosecutors. Junius <a name="fnm345" id="fnm345"></a>Mauricus<a href="#fn345" class="fnnum">345</a> accordingly petitioned Domitian
that the senate might be allowed access to the minutes of the
imperial cabinet, in order to find out who had applied for leave to
bring a prosecution and against whom. The answer was that on such a
question as this the emperor must be consulted.
<a name="IVchap41" id="IVchap41"></a><span class="chapnum">41</span>Accordingly, at the instigation of its leading members, the
senate framed an oath in these words, 'I call heaven to witness that
I have never countenanced any action prejudicial to any man's civil
status, nor have I derived any profit or any office from the
misfortune of any Roman citizen.' The magistrates vied with each
other in their haste to take this oath, and the other members <a name="page147" id="page147" ></a><span class="pagenum">147</span>did
the same, when called upon to speak. Those who had a guilty
conscience were alarmed, and managed to alter the wording of the
oath by various devices. The house meanwhile applauded every sign of
scruple, and protested against each case of perjury. This kind of
informal censure fell most severely on Sariolenus Vocula, Nonius
Attianus, and Cestius Severus, who were notorious as habitual
informers under Nero. Against Sariolenus there was also a fresh
charge of having continued his practices with Vitellius. The members
went on shaking their fists at him until he left the house. They
next turned on Paccius Africanus, trying to hound him out in the
same way. He was supposed to have suggested to Nero the murder of
the two brothers <a name="fnm346" id="fnm346"></a>Scribonius,<a href="#fn346" class="fnnum">346</a> who were famous for their
friendship and their wealth. Africanus dared not admit his guilt,
though he could not very well deny it. So he swung round on Vibius
Crispus,<a name="fnm347" id="fnm347"></a><a href="#fn347" class="fnnum">347</a> who was pestering him with questions, and tried to
turn the tables by implicating him in the charges which he could not
rebut, thus shifting the odium on to his accomplice.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap42" id="IVchap42"></a><span class="chapnum">42</span>On this occasion Vipstanus <a name="fnm348" id="fnm348"></a>Messala<a href="#fn348" class="fnnum">348</a> gained a great
reputation, both for dutiful affection and for eloquence, by
venturing to intercede for his brother Aquilius <a name="fnm349" id="fnm349"></a>Regulus,<a href="#fn349" class="fnnum">349</a>
although he had not attained the senatorial <a name="fnm350" id="fnm350"></a>age.<a href="#fn350" class="fnnum">350</a> Regulus had
fallen into great disfavour for having <a name="page148" id="page148" ></a><span class="pagenum">148</span>brought about the ruin of
the noble families of the Crassi and of Orfitus. It was supposed
that, though quite a young man, he had voluntarily undertaken the
prosecution, not to escape any danger which was threatening him, but
from purely ambitious motives. Crassus' wife, Sulpicia Praetextata,
and his four sons were anxious to secure revenge if the senate would
grant a trial. Messala therefore made no attempt to defend the case
or the accused, but tried to shelter his brother, and had already
won over some of the senators. Curtius Montanus now attacked him in
a savage speech, and even went so far as to charge Regulus with
having given money to Piso's murderer after Galba's death, and with
having bitten Piso's <a name="fnm351" id="fnm351"></a>head.<a href="#fn351" class="fnnum">351</a> 'That,' said he, 'Nero certainly did
not compel you to do. You purchased neither position nor safety by
that savage piece of cruelty. We may put up with the pleas of those
wretches who prefer to ruin others rather than endanger their own
lives. But your father's banishment had guaranteed your security.
His property had been divided amongst his <a name="fnm352" id="fnm352"></a>creditors.<a href="#fn352" class="fnnum">352</a> You were
not of an age to stand for office. Nero had nothing either to hope
or to fear from you. Your talents were as yet untried and you had
never exerted them in any man's defence, yet your lust for blood,
your insatiable ambition, led you to stain your young hands in the
blood of Rome's nobility. At one swoop <a name="page149" id="page149" ></a><span class="pagenum">149</span>you caused the ruin of
innocent youths, of old and distinguished statesmen, of high-born
ladies; and out of the country's disaster you secured for yourself
the spoils of two ex-consuls,<a name="fnm353" id="fnm353"></a><a href="#fn353" class="fnnum">353</a> stuffed seven million sesterces
into your purse, and shone with the reflected glory of a priesthood.
You would blame Nero's lack of enterprise because he took one
household at a time, thus causing unnecessary fatigue to himself and
his informers, when he might have ruined the whole senate at a
single word. Why, gentlemen, you must indeed keep and preserve to
yourselves a counsellor of such ready resource. Let each generation
have its good examples: and as our old men follow Eprius Marcellus
or Vibius Crispus, let the rising generation emulate Regulus.
Villainy finds followers even when it fails. What if it flourish and
prosper? If we hesitate to touch a mere ex-quaestor, shall we be any
bolder when he has been praetor and consul? Or do you suppose that
the race of tyrants came to an end in Nero? That is what the people
believed who outlived Tiberius or Caligula, and meanwhile there
arose one more infamous and more bloody <a name="fnm354" id="fnm354"></a>still.<a href="#fn354" class="fnnum">354</a> We are not
afraid of Vespasian. We trust his years and his natural moderation.
But a good precedent outlives a good sovereign. Gentlemen, we are
growing effete: we are no longer that senate which, after Nero had
been killed, clamoured for the punishment of all informers and their
menials according to our ancestors'<a name="page150" id="page150" ></a><span class="pagenum">150</span> rigorous prescription. The best
chance comes on the day after the death of a bad emperor.'</p>

<p><a name="IVchap43" id="IVchap43"></a><span class="chapnum">43</span>The senate listened to Montanus's speech with such sympathy
that Helvidius began to hope that it might be possible to get a
verdict even against Marcellus. Beginning with a eulogy of Cluvius
Rufus, who, though quite as rich and as eloquent as Marcellus, had
never brought any one into trouble under Nero, he went on to attack
Marcellus, both by contrasting him with Rufus and by pressing home
the charge against him. Feeling that the house was warming to this
rhetoric, Marcellus got up as though to leave, exclaiming, 'I am
off, Helvidius: I leave you your senate: you can tyrannize over it
under Caesar's nose.' Vibius Crispus followed Marcellus, and, though
both were angry, their expressions were very different. Marcellus
marched out with flashing eyes, Crispus with a smile on his face.
Eventually their friends went and brought them back. Thus the
struggle grew more and more heated between a well-meaning majority
and a small but powerful minority; and since they were both animated
by irreconcilable hatred, the day was spent in vain recriminations.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap44" id="IVchap44"></a><span class="chapnum">44</span>At the next sitting Domitian opened by recommending them to
forget their grievances and grudges and the unavoidable exigences of
the recent past. Mucianus then at great length moved a motion in
favour of the prosecutors, issuing a mild warning, almost in terms
of entreaty, to those who wanted to revive actions which had been
begun and dropped.<a name="page151" id="page151" ></a><span class="pagenum">151</span> Seeing that their attempt at independence was
being thwarted, the senate gave it up. However, that it might not
seem as if the senate's opinion had been flouted and complete
impunity granted for all crimes committed under Nero, Mucianus
forced Octavius Sagitta and Antistius Sosianus, who had returned
from exile, to go back to the islands to which they had been
confined. Octavius had committed adultery with Pontia Postumina,
and, on her refusal to marry him, had murdered her in a fit of
jealous fury. Sosianus was an unprincipled scoundrel who had been
the ruin of <a name="fnm355" id="fnm355"></a>many.<a href="#fn355" class="fnnum">355</a> The senate had found them both guilty, and
passed a heavy sentence of exile, nor had their penalty been
remitted, although others were allowed to return. However, this
failed to allay the ill-feeling against Mucianus, for Sosianus and
Sagitta, whether they returned or not, were of no importance,
whereas people were afraid of the professional prosecutors, who were
men of wealth and ability and experts in crime.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap45" id="IVchap45"></a><span class="chapnum">45</span>Unanimity was gradually restored in the senate by the
holding of a trial according to ancient precedent, before a court of
the whole house. A senator named Manlius Patruitus complained that
he had been beaten before a mob of people in the colony of Siena by
order of the local magistrates. Nor had the affront stopped there.
They had held a mock funeral before his eyes, and had accompanied
their dirges and lamentations with gross insults levelled at the
whole senate. The <a name="page152" id="page152" ></a><span class="pagenum">152</span>accused were summoned; their case was tried; they
were convicted and punished. A further decree of the senate was
passed admonishing the commons of Siena to pay more respect to the
laws. About the same time Antonius Flamma was prosecuted by Cyrene
for extortion, and exiled for the inhumanity of his conduct.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap46" id="IVchap46"></a><span class="chapnum">46</span>Meanwhile, a mutiny almost broke out among the soldiers.
The men who had been discharged by <a name="fnm356" id="fnm356"></a>Vitellius<a href="#fn356" class="fnnum">356</a> came together
again in support of Vespasian, and demanded re-admission. They were
joined by the selected legionaries who had also been led to hope for
service in the Guards, and they now demanded the pay they had been
promised. Even the <a name="fnm357" id="fnm357"></a>Vitellians<a href="#fn357" class="fnnum">357</a> alone could not have been
dispersed without serious bloodshed, but it would require immense
sums of money to retain the services of such a large number of men.
Mucianus accordingly entered the barracks to make a careful estimate
of each man's term of service. He formed up the victorious troops
with their own arms and distinctive decorations, each company a few
paces from the next. Then the Vitellians who had surrendered, as we
have described, at <a name="fnm358" id="fnm358"></a>Bovillae,<a href="#fn358" class="fnnum">358</a> and all the other soldiers who had
been hunted down in the city and its neighbourhood, were marched out
almost entirely without arms or uniforms. Mucianus then had them
<a name="page153" id="page153" ></a><span class="pagenum">153</span>sorted out, and drew up in separate corps the troops of the German
army, of the British army, and of any others that were in Rome.
Their first glance at the scene astounded them. Facing them they saw
what looked like a fighting front bristling with weapons, while they
were caught in a trap, defenceless and foul with dirt. As soon as
they began to be sorted out a panic seized them. The German troops
in particular were terrified at their isolation, and felt they were
being told off for slaughter. They embraced their comrades and clung
upon their necks, asking for one last kiss, begging not to be left
alone, crying out, 'Our cause is the same as yours, why should our
fate be different?' They appealed now to Mucianus, now to the absent
emperor, and lastly to the powers of Heaven, until Mucianus came to
the rescue of their imaginary terrors by calling them all 'sworn
servants of one emperor', for he found that the victorious army was
joining in and seconding their tears with cheering. On that day the
matter ended there. A few days later, when Domitian addressed them,
they received him with renewed confidence, refused his offer of
lands, and begged for enlistment and their pay instead. This was
only a petition, but one that could not be refused: so they were
admitted to the Guards. Subsequently, those who had grown old and
completed the regular term of <a name="fnm359" id="fnm359"></a>service<a href="#fn359" class="fnnum">359</a> were honourably
discharged. Others were dismissed for misbehaviour, but one by one
at <a name="page154" id="page154" ></a><span class="pagenum">154</span>different times, which is always the safest method of weakening
any kind of conspiracy.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap47" id="IVchap47"></a><span class="chapnum">47</span>To return to the senate; a bill was now passed that a loan
of sixty million sesterces should be raised from private individuals
and administered by Pompeius Silvanus. This may have been a
financial necessity, or they may have wanted it to seem so. At any
rate the necessity soon ceased to exist, or else they gave up the
pretence. Domitian then carried a proposal that the consulships
conferred by Vitellius should be cancelled, and that a state funeral
should be held in honour of Flavius <a name="fnm360" id="fnm360"></a>Sabinus.<a href="#fn360" class="fnnum">360</a> Both proposals are
striking evidence of the fickleness of human fortune, which so often
makes the first last and the last first.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap48" id="IVchap48"></a><span class="chapnum">48</span>It was about this time that Lucius <a name="fnm361" id="fnm361"></a>Piso,<a href="#fn361" class="fnnum">361</a> the
pro-consul of Africa, was killed. To give a true explanation of this
murder we must go back and take a brief survey of certain matters
which are closely connected with the reasons for such crimes. Under
the sainted Augustus and Tiberius the pro-consul of Africa had in
his command one legion and some auxiliaries with which to guard the
frontier of the <a name="fnm362" id="fnm362"></a>empire.<a href="#fn362" class="fnnum">362</a> Caligula, who was restless by nature
and harboured suspicions <a name="page155" id="page155" ></a><span class="pagenum">155</span>of the then pro-consul, Marcus Silanus,
withdrew the legion from his command and put it under a legate whom
he sent out for the purpose. As each had an equal amount of
patronage and their functions overlapped, Caligula thus caused a
state of friction which was further aggravated by regrettable
quarrels. The greater permanence of his <a name="fnm363" id="fnm363"></a>tenure<a href="#fn363" class="fnnum">363</a> gradually
strengthened the legate's position, and perhaps an inferior is
always anxious to vie with his betters. The most eminent governors,
on the other hand, were more careful of their comfort than of their
authority.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap49" id="IVchap49"></a><span class="chapnum">49</span>At the present time the legion in Africa was commanded by
Valerius <a name="fnm364" id="fnm364"></a>Festus,<a href="#fn364" class="fnnum">364</a> an extravagant young man, immoderately
ambitious, whose kinship with Vitellius had given him some anxiety.
He had frequent interviews with Piso, and it is impossible to tell
whether he tempted Piso to rebel or resisted Piso's temptations. No
one was present at their interviews, which were held in private, and
after Piso's death most people were inclined to sympathize with his
murderer. Beyond doubt the province and the garrison were
unfavourable to Vespasian. Besides, some of the Vitellian refugees
from Rome pointed out to Piso that the Gallic provinces were
wavering. Germany was ready to rebel, and he himself was in danger;
'and,' they added, 'if you earn suspicion in peace your safest
<a name="page156" id="page156" ></a><span class="pagenum">156</span>course is war.' Meanwhile, Claudius Sagitta, who commanded Petra's
Horse,<a name="fnm365" id="fnm365"></a><a href="#fn365" class="fnnum">365</a> made a good crossing and outstripped the centurion
Papirius, who had been sent out by Mucianus and was commissioned, so
Sagitta affirmed, to assassinate Piso. Sagitta further stated that
Galerianus,<a name="fnm366" id="fnm366"></a><a href="#fn366" class="fnnum">366</a> Piso's cousin and son-in-law, had already been
murdered, and told him that while his one hope lay in taking a bold
step, there were two courses open to him: he might either take up
arms on the spot, or he might prefer to sail to Gaul and offer to
lead the Vitellian armies. This made no impression on Piso. When the
centurion whom Mucianus had sent arrived at the gates of Carthage,
he kept on shouting all sorts of congratulations to Piso on becoming
emperor. The people he met, who were astounded at this unexpected
miracle, were instructed to take up the cry. With a crowd's usual
credulity, they rushed into the forum calling on Piso to appear, and
as they had a passion for flattery and took no interest in the
truth, they proceeded to fill the whole place with a confused noise
of cheering. Piso, however, either at a hint from Sagitta, or from
his natural good sense, would not show himself in public or give way
to the excitement of the crowd. He examined the centurion, and
learnt that his object was to trump up a charge against him and then
kill <a name="fnm367" id="fnm367"></a>him.<a href="#fn367" class="fnnum">367</a> He accordingly had the man executed more from
indignation against <a name="page157" id="page157" ></a><span class="pagenum">157</span>the assassin than in any hope of saving his
life; for he found that the man had been one of the murderers of
Clodius <a name="fnm368" id="fnm368"></a>Macer,<a href="#fn368" class="fnnum">368</a> and after staining his hand in the blood of a
military officer was now proposing to turn it against a civil
governor. Piso then reprimanded the Carthaginians in an edict which
clearly showed his anxiety, and refrained from performing even the
routine of his office, shutting himself up in his house, for fear
that he might by accident provide some pretext for further
demonstrations.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap50" id="IVchap50"></a><span class="chapnum">50</span>When the news of the popular excitement and the centurion's
execution reached the ears of Festus, considerably exaggerated and
with the usual admixture of falsehood, he at once sent off a party
of horsemen to murder Piso. Riding at full speed, they reached the
governor's house in the twilight of early dawn and broke in with
drawn swords. As Festus had mainly chosen Carthaginian auxiliaries
and Moors to do the murder, most of them did not know Piso by sight.
However, near his bedroom they happened on a slave and asked him
where Piso was and what he looked like. In answer the slave told
them a heroic lie and said he was Piso, whereupon they immediately
cut him down. However, Piso himself was killed very soon after, for
there was one man among them who knew him, and that was Baebius
Massa, one of the imperial agents in Africa, who was already a
danger to all the best men in Rome. His name will recur again and
again in this narrative, as one of the causes of the troubles <a name="page158" id="page158" ></a><span class="pagenum">158</span>which
beset us later <a name="fnm369" id="fnm369"></a>on.<a href="#fn369" class="fnnum">369</a> Festus had been waiting at <a name="fnm370" id="fnm370"></a>Adrumetum<a href="#fn370" class="fnnum">370</a> to
see how things went, and he now hastened to rejoin his legion. He
had the camp-prefect, Caetronius Pisanus, put in irons, alleging
that he was one of Piso's accomplices, though his real motive was
personal dislike. He then punished some of the soldiers and
centurions and rewarded others; in neither case for their deserts,
but because he wanted it to be thought that he had stamped out a
war. His next task was to settle the differences between Oea and
Lepcis.<a name="fnm371" id="fnm371"></a><a href="#fn371" class="fnnum">371</a> These had had a trivial origin in thefts of fruit and
cattle by the peasants, but they were now trying to settle them in
open warfare. Oea, being inferior in numbers, had called in the aid
of the <a name="fnm372" id="fnm372"></a>Garamantes,<a href="#fn372" class="fnnum">372</a> an invincible tribe, who were always a
fruitful source of damage to their neighbours. Thus the people of
Lepcis were in great straits. Their fields had been wasted far and
wide, and they had fled in terror under shelter of their walls, when
the Roman auxiliaries, both horse and foot, arrived on the scene.
They routed the Garamantes and recovered all the booty, except what
the nomads had already sold among the inaccessible hut-settlements
of the far interior.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap51" id="IVchap51"></a><span class="chapnum">51</span>After the battle of Cremona and the arrival of good <a name="page159" id="page159" ></a><span class="pagenum">159</span>news
from every quarter, Vespasian now heard of Vitellius' death. A large
number of people of all classes, who were as lucky as they were
adventurous, successfully braved the winter seas on purpose to bring
him the <a name="fnm373" id="fnm373"></a>news.<a href="#fn373" class="fnnum">373</a> There also arrived envoys from King Vologaesus
offering the services of forty thousand Parthian <a name="fnm374" id="fnm374"></a>cavalry.<a href="#fn374" class="fnnum">374</a> It
was, indeed, a proud and fortunate situation to be courted with such
splendid offers of assistance, and to need none of them. Vologaesus
was duly thanked and instructed to send his envoys to the senate and
to understand that peace had been made. Vespasian now devoted his
attention to the affairs of Italy and the Capitol, and received an
unfavourable report of Domitian, who seemed to be trespassing beyond
the natural sphere of an emperor's youthful son. He accordingly
handed over the flower of his army to Titus, who was to finish off
the war with the <a name="fnm375" id="fnm375"></a>Jews.<a href="#fn375" class="fnnum">375</a></p>

<p><a name="IVchap52" id="IVchap52"></a><span class="chapnum">52</span>It is said that before his departure Titus had a long talk
with his father and begged him not to be rash and lose his temper at
these incriminating reports, but to meet his son in a forgiving and
unprejudiced spirit, 'Neither legions nor fleets,' he is reported to
have said, 'are such sure bulwarks of the throne as a number of
children. Time, chance and often, too, ambition and misunderstanding
weaken, alienate or extinguish friendship: a man's own blood cannot
be severed from him; and above all is this the case with <a name="page160" id="page160" ></a><span class="pagenum">160</span>a
sovereign, for, while others enjoy his good fortune, his misfortunes
only concern his nearest kin. Nor again are brothers likely to
remain good friends unless their father sets them an example.' These
words had the effect of making Vespasian rather delighted at Titus'
goodness of heart than inclined to forgive Domitian. 'You may ease
your mind,' he said to Titus, 'It is now your duty to increase the
prestige of Rome on the field: I will concern myself with peace at
home.' Though the weather was still very rough, Vespasian at once
launched his fastest corn-ships with a full cargo. For the city was
on the verge of <a name="fnm376" id="fnm376"></a>famine.<a href="#fn376" class="fnnum">376</a> Indeed, there were not supplies for
more than ten days in the public granaries at the moment when
Vespasian's convoy brought relief.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap53" id="IVchap53"></a><span class="chapnum">53</span>The task of restoring the <a name="fnm377" id="fnm377"></a>Capitol<a href="#fn377" class="fnnum">377</a> was entrusted to
Lucius Vestinus, who, though only a knight, yet in reputation and
influence could rank with the highest. He summoned all the
soothsayers,<a name="fnm378" id="fnm378"></a><a href="#fn378" class="fnnum">378</a> and they recommended that the ruins of the former
temple should be carried away to the <a name="fnm379" id="fnm379"></a>marshes<a href="#fn379" class="fnnum">379</a> and a new temple
erected on the same site: the gods were unwilling, they said, that
the original form of the building should be changed. On the 21st of
June, a day of bright sun<a name="page161" id="page161" ></a><span class="pagenum">161</span>shine, the whole consecrated area of the
temple was decorated with chaplets and garlands. In marched
soldiers, all men with names of good omen, carrying branches of
lucky trees:<a name="fnm380" id="fnm380"></a><a href="#fn380" class="fnnum">380</a> then came the Vestal Virgins accompanied by boys
and girls, each of whom had father and mother <a name="fnm381" id="fnm381"></a>alive,<a href="#fn381" class="fnnum">381</a> and they
cleansed it all by sprinkling fresh water from a spring or
river.<a name="fnm382" id="fnm382"></a><a href="#fn382" class="fnnum">382</a> Next, while the high priest, Plautius Aelianus, dictated
the proper formulae, Helvidius Priscus, the praetor, first
consecrated the site by a solemn <a name="fnm383" id="fnm383"></a>sacrifice<a href="#fn383" class="fnnum">383</a> of a pig, a sheep
and an ox, and then duly offering the entrails on an altar of turf,
he prayed to Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, as the guardian deities of
the empire, to prosper the enterprise, and by divine grace to bring
to completion this house of theirs which human piety had here begun.
He then took hold of the chaplets to which the ropes holding the
foundation-stone were attached. At the same moment the other
magistrates and the priests and senators and knights and large
numbers of the populace in joyous excitement with one great effort
dragged the huge stone into its place. On every side gifts of gold
and silver were flung into the foundations, and <a name="page162" id="page162" ></a><span class="pagenum">162</span>blocks of virgin
ore unscathed by any furnace, just as they had come from the womb of
the earth. For the soothsayers had given out that the building must
not be desecrated by the use of stone or gold that had been put to
any other purpose. The height of the roof was raised. This was the
only change that religious scruples would allow, and it was felt to
be the only point in which the former temple lacked grandeur.</p>

<h3><a name="Loss_Germany" id="Loss_Germany"></a>The Loss of Germany</h3>

<p><a name="IVchap54" id="IVchap54"></a><span class="chapnum">54</span>Meanwhile,<a name="fnm384" id="fnm384"></a><a href="#fn384" class="fnnum">384</a> the news of Vitellius' death had spread
through Gaul and Germany and redoubled the vigour of the war.
Civilis now dropped all pretence and hurled himself upon the Roman
Empire. The Vitellian legions felt that even foreign slavery was
preferable to owning Vespasian's sovereignty. The Gauls too had
taken heart. A rumour had been spread that our winter camps in
Moesia and Pannonia were being blockaded by Sarmatians and
Dacians:<a name="fnm385" id="fnm385"></a><a href="#fn385" class="fnnum">385</a> similar stories were fabricated about Britain: the
Gauls began to think that the fortune of the Roman arms was the same
all the world over. But above all, the burning of the Capitol led
them to believe that the empire was coming to an end. 'Once in old
days the Gauls had captured Rome, but her empire had stood firm
since Jupiter's high-place was left unscathed. But now, <a name="page163" id="page163" ></a><span class="pagenum">163</span>so the
<a name="fnm386" id="fnm386"></a>Druids<a href="#fn386" class="fnnum">386</a> with superstitious folly kept dinning into their ears,
this fatal fire was a sign of Heaven's anger, and meant that the
Transalpine tribes were destined now to rule the world.' It was also
persistently rumoured that the Gallic chieftains, whom Otho had sent
to work against <a name="fnm387" id="fnm387"></a>Vitellius,<a href="#fn387" class="fnnum">387</a> had agreed, before they parted, that
if Rome sank under its internal troubles in an unbroken sequence of
civil wars, they would not fail the cause of the Gallic freedom.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap55" id="IVchap55"></a><span class="chapnum">55</span>Previous to the murder of Hordeonius <a name="fnm388" id="fnm388"></a>Flaccus<a href="#fn388" class="fnnum">388</a> nothing
had leaked out to arouse suspicions of a conspiracy, but when he had
been assassinated, negotiations passed between Civilis and
Classicus,<a name="fnm389" id="fnm389"></a><a href="#fn389" class="fnnum">389</a> who commanded the Treviran cavalry. Classicus was
far above the rest both in birth and in wealth. He came of royal
line and his stock was famous both in peace and war. It was his
boast that his family had given Rome more enemies than allies. These
two were now joined by Julius Tutor and Julius Sabinus, the one a
Treviran, the other a Lingonian. Tutor had been appointed by
Vitellius to watch the bank of the <a name="fnm390" id="fnm390"></a>Rhine.<a href="#fn390" class="fnnum">390</a> Sabinus'<a name="page164" id="page164" ></a><span class="pagenum">164</span> natural
vanity was further inflamed by spurious pretensions of high birth,
for he alleged that his great-grandmother's beauty had caught the
fancy of Julius Caesar during the campaign in Gaul, and that they
had committed adultery. These four tested the temper of the rest in
private interviews, and having bound to the conspiracy those who
were considered fit, they held a conference at Cologne in a private
house, the general feeling in the city being hostile to such plans
as theirs. A few of the Ubii and Tungri, indeed, attended, but the
Treviri and Lingonians were the backbone of the conspiracy. Nor
would they tolerate deliberation or delay. They vied with each other
in protesting that Rome was distracted by internal quarrels; legions
had been cut to pieces, Italy devastated, the city was on the point
of being taken, while all her armies were occupied with wars of
their own in different quarters. They need only garrison the Alps
and then, when liberty had taken firm root, they could discuss
together what limit each tribe should set to its exercise of power.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap56" id="IVchap56"></a><span class="chapnum">56</span>All this was no sooner spoken than applauded. About the
remnant of Vitellius' army they were in some doubt. Many held that
they ought to be killed as being treacherous and insubordinate and
stained with the blood of their generals. However, the idea of
sparing them carried the day. To destroy all hope of pardon would
only steel their obstinacy: it was much better to seduce them into
alliance: only the generals need be killed; a guilty conscience and
the hope of pardon would soon bring the rest flocking over <a name="page165" id="page165" ></a><span class="pagenum">165</span>to their
flag. Such was the tenor of their first meeting. Agitators were sent
all over Gaul to stir up war. The conspirators themselves feigned
loyalty to Vocula, hoping to catch him off his <a name="fnm391" id="fnm391"></a>guard.<a href="#fn391" class="fnnum">391</a> There
were, indeed, traitors who reported all this to Vocula, but he was
not strong enough to crush the conspiracy, his legions being
short-handed and unreliable. Between suspected troops on one side
and secret enemies on the other, it seemed his best course under the
circumstances to dissemble, as they were doing, and thus use their
own weapons against them. So he marched down the river to Cologne.
There he found Claudius Labeo, who after being taken prisoner, as
described <a name="fnm392" id="fnm392"></a>above,<a href="#fn392" class="fnnum">392</a> and relegated to the Frisii, had bribed his
guards and escaped to Cologne. He promised that if Vocula would
provide him with troops, he would go to the Batavi and win back the
better part of their community to the Roman alliance. He was given a
small force of horse and foot. Without venturing any attempt upon
the Batavi, he attracted a few of the Nervii and <a name="fnm393" id="fnm393"></a>Baetasii<a href="#fn393" class="fnnum">393</a> to
his standard, and proceeded to harass the Canninefates and
Marsaci<a href="#fn393" class="fnnum">393</a> more by stealth than open warfare.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap57" id="IVchap57"></a><span class="chapnum">57</span>Lured by the treachery of the Gauls, Vocula marched out
against his <a name="fnm394" id="fnm394"></a>enemy.<a href="#fn394" class="fnnum">394</a> Not far from Vetera, Classicus and Tutor
rode <a name="fnm395" id="fnm395"></a>forward<a href="#fn395" class="fnnum">395</a> on a pretext of scouting, <a name="page166" id="page166" ></a><span class="pagenum">166</span>and ratified their
compact with the German leaders. They were now for the first time
separated from the legions, and entrenched themselves in a camp of
their own. At this, Vocula loudly protested that Rome was not as yet
so shattered by civil war as to earn the contempt of tribes like the
Treviri and Lingones. She could still rely on loyal provinces and
victorious armies, on the good fortune of the empire and the
avenging hand of God. Thus it was that in former days Sacrovir and
the <a name="fnm396" id="fnm396"></a>Aedui,<a href="#fn396" class="fnnum">396</a> more lately Vindex and the Gallic provinces had each
been crushed at a single battle. Now, again, these treaty-breakers
must expect to face the same powers of Providence and Destiny. The
sainted Julius and the sainted Augustus had understood these people
better: it was Galba's reduction of the <a name="fnm397" id="fnm397"></a>tribute<a href="#fn397" class="fnnum">397</a> that had
clothed them in enmity and pride. 'They are our enemies to-day
because their yoke is easy: when they have been stripped and
plundered they will be our friends.' After these spirited words,
seeing that Classicus and Tutor still persisted in their treachery,
he turned back and retired to Novaesium, while the Gauls encamped a
couple of miles away. Thither the centurions and soldiers flocked to
sell their souls. This was, indeed, an unheard <a name="page167" id="page167" ></a><span class="pagenum">167</span>of villainy that
Roman soldiers should swear allegiance to a foreign power, and offer
as a pledge for this heinous crime either to kill or imprison their
generals. Though many urged Vocula to escape, he felt that he must
make a bold stand, so he summoned a meeting and spoke
<a name="IVchap58" id="IVchap58"></a><span class="chapnum">58</span>somewhat as follows:&mdash;'Never before have I addressed you
with such feelings of anxiety for you, or with such indifference to
my own fate. That plans are being laid for my destruction I am glad
enough to hear: in such a parlous case as this I look for death as
the end of all my troubles. It is for you that I feel shame and
pity. It is not that a field of battle awaits you, for that would
only accord with the laws of warfare and the just rights of
combatants, but because Classicus hopes that with your hands he can
make war upon the Roman people, and flourishes before you an oath of
allegiance to the Empire of All Gaul. What though fortune and
courage have deserted us for the moment, have we not glorious
examples in the past? How often have not Roman soldiers chosen to
die rather than be driven from their post? Often have our allies
endured the destruction of their cities and given themselves and
their wives and children to the flames, without any other reward for
such an end save the name of honourable men. At this very moment
Roman troops are enduring famine and siege at Vetera, and neither
threats nor promises can move them, while we, besides arms and men
and fine fortifications, have supplies enough to last through any
length of war. Money, too&mdash;the other day there was enough even <a name="page168" id="page168" ></a><span class="pagenum">168</span>for
a donative, and whether you choose to say that it was given you by
Vespasian or by Vitellius, at any rate you got it from a Roman
Emperor. After all the engagements you have won, after routing the
enemy at Gelduba, at Vetera, it would be shameful enough to shirk
battle, but you have your trenches and your walls, and there are
ways of gaining time until armies come flocking from the
neighbouring provinces to your rescue. Granted that you dislike me;
well, there are others to lead you, whether legate, tribune,
centurion, and even private soldier. But do not let this portent be
trumpeted over the whole world, that Civilis and Classicus are going
to invade Italy with you in their train. Suppose the Germans and
Gauls lead the way to the walls of Rome, will you turn your arms
upon your fatherland? The mere thought of such a crime is horrible.
Will you stand sentry for the Treviran Tutor? Shall a Batavian give
you the signal for battle? Will you swell the ranks of German
hordes? And what will be the issue of your crime, when the Roman
legions take the field against you? Desertion upon desertion,
treachery upon treachery! You will be drifting miserably between the
old allegiance and the new, with the curse of Heaven on your heads.
Almighty Jupiter, whom we have worshipped at triumph after triumph
for eight hundred and twenty years; and Quirinus, Father of our
Rome, if it be not your pleasure that under my command this camp be
kept clean from the stain of dishonour, grant at the least, I humbly
beseech ye, that it never be defiled with <a name="page169" id="page169" ></a><span class="pagenum">169</span>the pollution of a Tutor
or a Classicus; and to these soldiers of Rome give either innocence
of heart or a speedy repentance before the harm is done.'</p>

<p><a name="IVchap59" id="IVchap59"></a><span class="chapnum">59</span>The speech was variously received, with feelings
fluctuating between hope, fear, and shame. Vocula withdrew and began
to prepare for his end, but his freedmen and slaves prevented him
from forestalling by his own hand a dreadful death. As it was,
Classicus dispatched Aemilius Longinus, a deserter from the First
legion, who quickly murdered him. For Herennius and Numisius
imprisonment was thought sufficient. Classicus then assumed the
uniform and insignia of a Roman general, and thus entered the camp.
Hardened though he was to every kind of crime, words failed
him,<a name="fnm398" id="fnm398"></a><a href="#fn398" class="fnnum">398</a> and he could only read out the oath. Those who were
present swore allegiance to the Empire of All Gaul. He then gave
high promotion to Vocula's assassin, and rewarded the others each
according to the villainy of his service.</p>

<p>The command was now divided between Tutor and Classicus. Tutor at
the head of a strong force besieged Cologne and forced the
inhabitants and all the soldiers on the Upper Rhine to take the same
oath of allegiance. At Mainz he killed the officers and drove away
the camp-prefect, who had refused to swear. Classicus ordered all
the greatest scoundrels among the deserters to go to Vetera and
offer pardon to the besieged if they would yield to circumstances:
otherwise there was no hope for them: they should suffer famine and
sword <a name="page170" id="page170" ></a><span class="pagenum">170</span>and every extremity. The messengers further cited their own
example.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap60" id="IVchap60"></a><span class="chapnum">60</span>Torn by a conflict of loyalty and hunger, the besieged
vacillated between honour and disgrace. While they hesitated, all
their sources of food, both usual and unusual, began to fail them.
They had eaten their mules and horses and all the other animals
which, though foul and unclean, their straits had forced into use.
At last they took to grubbing up the shrubs and roots and the grass
that grew between the stones, and became a very pattern of endurance
in wretchedness, until at last they soiled their glory by a shameful
end. Envoys were sent to Civilis begging him to save their lives.
Even then he refused to receive their petition until they had sworn
allegiance to All Gaul. He then negotiated for the plunder of the
camp and sent guards, some to secure the money, servants and
baggage, and others to conduct the men themselves out of the camp
with empty hands. About five miles down the road their line was
surprised by an ambush of Germans. The bravest fell on the spot;
many were cut down in flight; the rest got back to camp. Civilis,
indeed, complained that the Germans had criminally broken faith and
rebuked them for it. There is no evidence to show whether this was a
pretence or whether he was really unable to restrain his savage
troops. The camp was plundered and burnt, and all who had survived
the battle were devoured by the flames.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap61" id="IVchap61"></a><span class="chapnum">61</span>When Civilis first took up arms against Rome he made a vow,
such as is common with barbarians, to <a name="page171" id="page171" ></a><span class="pagenum">171</span>let his ruddled <a name="fnm399" id="fnm399"></a>hair<a href="#fn399" class="fnnum">399</a>
grow wild; now that he had at last accomplished the destruction of
the legions he had it cut. It is said also that he put up some of
the prisoners for his little son to shoot in sport with javelins and
arrows. However that may be, he did not himself swear allegiance to
All Gaul, nor did he force any of the Batavi to do so. He felt that
he could rely on the strength of the Germans, and that if any
quarrel arose with the Gauls about the empire, his fame would give
him an advantage. Munius Lupercus, one of the Roman
commanding-officers, was sent among other presents to Veleda, a
virgin of the Bructeran tribe who wielded a wide-spread
authority.<a name="fnm400" id="fnm400"></a><a href="#fn400" class="fnnum">400</a> It is an ancient custom in Germany to credit a
number of women with prophetic powers, and with the growth of
superstition these develop into goddesses. At this moment Veleda's
influence was at its height, for she had prophesied the success of
the Germans and the destruction of the Roman <a name="fnm401" id="fnm401"></a>army.<a href="#fn401" class="fnnum">401</a> However,
Lupercus was killed on the journey. A few of the centurions and
officers who had been born in Gaul were detained as a security for
good faith. The winter camps of the legions and of the auxiliary
infantry and cavalry were all dismantled and burnt, with the sole
exception of those at Mainz and <a name="fnm402" id="fnm402"></a>Vindonissa.<a href="#fn402" class="fnnum">402</a></p>

<p><a name="page172" id="page172" ></a><span class="pagenum">172</span><a name="IVchap62" id="IVchap62"></a><span class="chapnum">62</span>The Sixteenth legion and the auxiliary troops who had
surrendered with it now received orders to migrate from their
quarters at Novaesium to Trier, and a date was fixed by which they
had to leave their camp. They spent the meantime brooding on various
anxieties, the cowards all shuddering at the precedent of the
massacre at Vetera, the better sort covered with shame at their
disgrace. 'What sort of a march would this be? Whom would they have
to lead them? Everything would be decided by the will of those into
whose hands they had put their lives.' Others, again, were quite
indifferent to the disgrace, and simply stowed all their money and
most cherished possessions about their persons, while many got their
armour ready and buckled on their swords, as if for battle. While
they were still busy with these preparations the hour struck for
their departure, and it proved more bitter than they had expected.
Inside the trenches their disgrace was not so noticeable. The open
country and the light of day revealed their depth of shame. The
emperors' medallions had been torn <a name="fnm403" id="fnm403"></a>down<a href="#fn403" class="fnnum">403</a> and their standards
desecrated, while Gallic ensigns glittered all around them. They
marched in silence, like a long funeral procession, led by Claudius
Sanctus,<a name="fnm404" id="fnm404"></a><a href="#fn404" class="fnnum">404</a> a man whose sinister appearance&mdash;he had lost one
eye&mdash;was only surpassed by his weakness of intellect. Their disgrace
was doubled when they were joined by the First legion, who had left
their camp at<a name="page173" id="page173" ></a><span class="pagenum">173</span> Bonn. The famous news of their capture had spread,
and all the people who shortly before had trembled at the very name
of Rome, now came flocking out from fields and houses, and scattered
far and wide in transports of joy at this unwonted sight. Their
insulting glee was too much for 'The Picenum Horse'.<a name="fnm405" id="fnm405"></a><a href="#fn405" class="fnnum">405</a> Defying
all Sanctus' threats and promises, they turned off to Mainz, and
coming by chance upon Longinus, the man who killed Vocula, they slew
him with a shower of javelins and thus made a beginning of future
amends. The legions, without changing their route, came and camped
before the walls of Trier.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap63" id="IVchap63"></a><span class="chapnum">63</span>Highly elated by their success, Civilis and Classicus
debated whether they should allow their troops to sack Cologne.
Their natural savagery and lust for plunder inclined them to destroy
the town, but policy forbade; and they felt that in inaugurating a
new empire a reputation for clemency would be an asset. Civilis was
also moved by the memory of a past service, for at the beginning of
the outbreak his son had been arrested in Cologne, and they had kept
him in honourable custody. However, the tribes across the Rhine were
jealous of this rich and rising community, and held that the war
could only be ended either by throwing the settlement open to all
Germans without distinction or by destroying it and thereby
dispersing<a name="page174" id="page174" ></a><span class="pagenum">174</span> <a name="IVchap64" id="IVchap64"></a><span class="chapnum">64</span>the Ubii together with its other
inhabitants.<a name="fnm406" id="fnm406"></a><a href="#fn406" class="fnnum">406</a> Accordingly the <a name="fnm407" id="fnm407"></a>Tencteri,<a href="#fn407" class="fnnum">407</a> their nearest
neighbours across the Rhine, dispatched a deputation to lay a
message before a public meeting of the town. This was delivered by
the haughtiest of the delegates in some such terms as these:&mdash;'We
give thanks to the national gods of Germany and above all others, to
the god of war, that you are again incorporate in the German nation
and the German name, and we congratulate you that you will now at
last become free members of a free community. Until to-day the
Romans had closed to us the roads and rivers, and almost the very
air of heaven, to prevent all intercourse between us; or else they
offered a still fouler insult to born warriors, that we should meet
under supervision, unarmed and almost <a name="fnm408" id="fnm408"></a>naked,<a href="#fn408" class="fnnum">408</a> and should pay for
the privilege. Now, that our friendly alliance may be ratified for
all eternity, we demand of you that you pull down those bulwarks of
slavery, the walls of your town, for even wild beasts lose their
spirit if you keep them caged: that you put to the sword every Roman
on your soil, since tyrants are incompatible with freedom; that all
the property of those killed form a common stock and no one be
<a name="page175" id="page175" ></a><span class="pagenum">175</span>allowed to conceal anything or to secure any private advantage. It
must also be open both for us and for you to live on either
river-bank, as our forefathers could in earlier days. As daylight is
the natural heritage of all mankind, so the land of the world is
free to all brave men. Resume again the customs and manners of your
own country and throw off those luxurious habits which enslave
Rome's subjects far more effectively than Roman arms. Then, grown
simple and uncorrupt, you will forget your past slavery and either
know none but equals or hold empire over others.'</p>

<p><a name="IVchap65" id="IVchap65"></a><span class="chapnum">65</span>The townspeople took time to consider these proposals, and,
feeling that their apprehensions for the future forbade them to
assent, while their present circumstances forbade them to return a
plain negative, they answered as follows: 'We have seized our first
opportunity of freedom with more haste than prudence, because we
wanted to join hands with you and all our other German kinsmen. As
for our town-walls, seeing that the Roman armies are massing at this
moment, it would be safer for us to heighten them than to pull them
down. All the foreigners from Italy or the provinces who lived on
our soil have either perished in the war or fled to their own homes.
As for the original <a name="fnm409" id="fnm409"></a>settlers<a href="#fn409" class="fnnum">409</a>, who are united to us by ties of
marriage, they and their offspring regard this as their home, and we
do not think you are so unreason<a name="page176" id="page176" ></a><span class="pagenum">176</span>able as to ask us to kill our
parents and brothers and children. All taxes and commercial
restrictions we remit. We grant you free entry without supervision,
but you must come in daylight and unarmed, while these ties which
are still strange and new are growing into a long-established
custom. As arbitrators we will appoint Civilis and Veleda, and we
will ratify our compact in their presence.'</p>

<p>Thus the Tencteri were pacified. A deputation was sent with presents
to Civilis and Veleda, and obtained all that the people of Cologne
desired. They were not, however, allowed to approach and speak to
Veleda or even to see her, but were kept at a distance to inspire in
them the greater awe. She herself lived at the top of a high tower,
and one of her relatives was appointed to carry all the questions
and answers like a mediator between God and man.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap66" id="IVchap66"></a><span class="chapnum">66</span>Now that he had gained the accession of Cologne, Civilis
determined to win over the neighbouring communities or to declare
war in case of opposition. He reduced the <a name="fnm410" id="fnm410"></a>Sunuci<a href="#fn410" class="fnnum">410</a> and formed
their fighting strength into cohorts, but then found his advance
barred by Claudius <a name="fnm411" id="fnm411"></a>Labeo<a href="#fn411" class="fnnum">411</a> at the head of a hastily-recruited
band of Baetasii, Tungri, and Nervii.<a href="#fn411" class="fnnum">411</a> He had secured the bridge
over the Maas and relied on the strength of his position. A skirmish
in the narrow defile proved indecisive, until the Germans swam
across and took Labeo in the rear. At this point<a name="page177" id="page177" ></a><span class="pagenum">177</span> Civilis by a bold
move&mdash;or possibly by arrangement&mdash;rode into the lines of the Tungri
and called out in a loud voice, 'Our object in taking up arms is not
to secure empire for the Batavi and Treviri over other tribes. We
are far from any such arrogance. Take us as allies. I am come to
join you; whether as general or as private it is for you to choose.'
This had a great effect on the common soldiers, who began to sheathe
their swords. Then two of their chieftains, Campanus and Juvenalis,
surrendered the entire tribe. Labeo escaped before he was
surrounded. Civilis also received the allegiance of the Baetasii and
Nervii, and added their forces to his own. His power was now
immense, for all the Gallic communities were either terrified or
ready to offer willing support.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap67" id="IVchap67"></a><span class="chapnum">67</span>In the meantime, Julius <a name="fnm412" id="fnm412"></a>Sabinus,<a href="#fn412" class="fnnum">412</a> who had destroyed
every memorial of the Roman <a name="fnm413" id="fnm413"></a>alliance,<a href="#fn413" class="fnnum">413</a> assumed the title of
Caesar and proceeded to hurry a large unwieldy horde of his
tribesmen against the <a name="fnm414" id="fnm414"></a>Sequani,<a href="#fn414" class="fnnum">414</a> a neighbouring community,
faithful to Rome. The Sequani accepted battle: the good cause
prospered: the Lingones were routed. Sabinus fled the field with the
same rash haste with which he had plunged into battle. Wishing to
spread a rumour of his death, he took refuge in a house and set fire
to it, and was thus supposed to have perished by his own act. We
shall, however, relate in due course the devices by which <a name="page178" id="page178" ></a><span class="pagenum">178</span>he lay in
hiding and prolonged his life for nine more years, and allude also
to the loyalty of his friends and the memorable example set by his
wife <a name="fnm415" id="fnm415"></a>Epponina.<a href="#fn415" class="fnnum">415</a></p>

<h3><a name="Ebb_Tide" id="Ebb_Tide"></a>The Ebb-tide of Revolt</h3>

<p>This success on the part of the Sequani checked the rising flood.
The Gallic communities gradually came to their senses and began to
remember their obligations as allies. In this movement the <a name="fnm416" id="fnm416"></a>Remi<a href="#fn416" class="fnnum">416</a>
took the lead. They circulated a notice throughout Gaul, summoning a
meeting of delegates to consider whether liberty or peace was the
preferable alternative. <a name="IVchap68" id="IVchap68"></a><span class="chapnum">68</span>At Rome, however, all these
disasters were exaggerated, and Mucianus began to feel anxious. He
had already appointed Annius Gallus and Petilius Cerialis to the
chief command, and distinguished officers as they were, he was
afraid the conduct of such a war might be too much for them.
Moreover, he could not leave Rome without government, but he was
afraid of Domitian's unbridled passions, while, as we have already
seen,<a name="fnm417" id="fnm417"></a><a href="#fn417" class="fnnum">417</a> he suspected Antonius Primus and Arrius Varus. Varus, as
commanding the Guards, still had the chief power and influence in
his hands. Mucianus accordingly displaced him, but, as a
compensation, made him Director of <a name="page179" id="page179" ></a><span class="pagenum">179</span>the Corn-supply. As he had also
to placate Domitian, who was inclined to support Varus, he appointed
to the command of the Guards Arrecinus Clemens, who was connected
with Vespasian's <a name="fnm418" id="fnm418"></a>family<a href="#fn418" class="fnnum">418</a> and very friendly with Domitian. He
also impressed it upon Domitian that Clemens' father had filled this
command with great distinction under Caligula: that his name and his
character would both find favour with the troops, and that, although
he was a member of the <a name="fnm419" id="fnm419"></a>senate,<a href="#fn419" class="fnnum">419</a> he was quite able to fill both
positions. He then chose his staff, some as being the most eminent
men in the country, others as recommended by private influence.</p>

<p>Thus both Domitian and Mucianus made ready to start, but with very
different feelings. Domitian was full of the sanguine haste of
youth, while Mucianus kept devising delays to check this enthusiasm.
He was afraid that if Domitian once seized control of an army, his
youthful self-assurance and his bad advisers would lead him into
action prejudicial both to peace and war. Three victorious legions,
the Eighth, Eleventh, and Thirteenth;<a name="fnm420" id="fnm420"></a><a href="#fn420" class="fnnum">420</a> the Twenty-first&mdash;one of
Vitellius' legions&mdash;and the Second, which had been newly enrolled,
all started for the front, some by way of the Poenine and
<a name="fnm421" id="fnm421"></a>Cottian<a href="#fn421" class="fnnum">421</a> Alps, others over the Graian<a name="page180" id="page180" ></a><span class="pagenum">180</span> <a name="fnm422" id="fnm422"></a>Alps.<a href="#fn422" class="fnnum">422</a> The Fourteenth
was also summoned from Britain, and the Sixth and First from Spain.</p>

<p>The rumour that this force was on its way, combined with the present
temper of the Gauls, inclined them to adopt a sober policy. Their
delegates now met in the territory of the Remi, where they found the
representatives of the Treviri awaiting them. One of these, Julius
Valentinus, who was the keenest instigator of a hostile policy,
delivered a set speech, in which he heaped spiteful aspersions on
the Roman people, making all the charges which are usually brought
against great empires. He was a clever agitator, whose mad rhetoric
made him popular with the crowd. <a name="IVchap69" id="IVchap69"></a><span class="chapnum">69</span>However, Julius Auspex, a
chieftain of the Remi, enlarged upon the power of Rome and the
blessings of peace. 'Any coward can begin a war,' he said, 'but it
is the brave who run the risks of its conduct: and here are the
legions already upon us.' Thus he restrained them, awakening a sense
of duty in all the sager breasts, and appealing to the fears of the
younger men. So, while applauding Valentinus' courage, they followed
the advice of Auspex. The fact that in Vindex's rising the Treviri
and Lingones sided with Verginius is known to have told against them
in Gaul. Many, too, were held back by tribal jealousy. They wanted
to know where the head-quarters of the war would be, to whom were
they to look for auspices and orders, and, if all went well, which
town would be chosen as the seat of government. Thus dissension
<a name="page181" id="page181" ></a><span class="pagenum">181</span>preceded victory. They angrily magnified, some their great
connexions, others their wealth and strength, others their
antiquity, until they grew tired of discussing the future and voted
for the existing state of things. Letters were written to the
Treviri in the name of All Gaul, bidding them cease hostilities,
suggesting, however, that pardon might be obtained, and that many
were ready to plead their cause if they showed repentance.
Valentinus opposed this mandate and made his tribesmen offer a deaf
ear to it. He was always less anxious to organize a campaign than to
make speeches on every possible occasion.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap70" id="IVchap70"></a><span class="chapnum">70</span>The result was that neither the Treviri nor the Lingones
nor the other rebel tribes behaved as if aware of the serious risks
they were undertaking. Even the leaders did not act in concert.
Civilis wandered over the wilds of the Belgic country, trying to
catch or expel Claudius Labeo. Classicus ordinarily took his ease,
apparently enjoying the fruits of empire. Even Tutor seemed in no
hurry to garrison the Upper Rhine and block the Alpine passes. In
the meantime, the Twenty-first legion made its way down from
Vindonissa, while Sextilius <a name="fnm423" id="fnm423"></a>Felix<a href="#fn423" class="fnnum">423</a> advanced through Raetia with
some auxiliary cohorts. These were joined by the 'Picked
Horse',<a name="fnm424" id="fnm424"></a><a href="#fn424" class="fnnum">424</a> a force that had been raised by Vitellius and then
deserted to Vespasian. This was commanded by Civilis' nephew, Julius
Briganticus,<a name="fnm425" id="fnm425"></a><a href="#fn425" class="fnnum">425</a> for uncle and nephew hated each other <a name="page182" id="page182" ></a><span class="pagenum">182</span>with all
the aggravated bitterness of near relatives. Tutor swelled his force
of Treviri with fresh levies from the Vangiones, Triboci, and
Caeracates,<a name="fnm426" id="fnm426"></a><a href="#fn426" class="fnnum">426</a> and a stiffening of Roman veterans, both horse and
foot, who had either been bribed or intimidated. These first cut up
an auxiliary cohort sent forward by Sextilius Felix, but on the
advance of the Roman army with its generals they loyally deserted to
their old flag, and were followed by the Triboci, Vangiones, and
Caeracates. Tutor, followed by his Treviri, avoided Mainz and fell
back on <a name="fnm427" id="fnm427"></a>Bingium,<a href="#fn427" class="fnnum">427</a> relying on his position there, as he had
broken down the bridge over the river Nava. However, Sextilius'
cohorts followed him up; some traitor showed them a ford; Tutor was
routed. This disaster was a crushing blow to the Treviri. The rank
and file dropped their weapons and took to the fields, while some of
their chieftains, hoping it might be thought that they had been the
first to lay down arms, took refuge among tribes who had never
repudiated the Roman alliance. The legions which had been moved, as
we saw <a name="fnm428" id="fnm428"></a>above,<a href="#fn428" class="fnnum">428</a> from Novaesium and Bonn to Trier, now
administered to themselves the oath of allegiance to Vespasian. This
happened in Valentinus' absence. When he arrived in furious
excitement, ready to spread universal <a name="page183" id="page183" ></a><span class="pagenum">183</span>ruin and confusion, the
legions withdrew into the friendly territory of the
Mediomatrici.<a name="fnm429" id="fnm429"></a><a href="#fn429" class="fnnum">429</a> Valentinus and Tutor then led the Treviri
forcibly back into the field, but first they killed the two Roman
officers, Herennius and <a name="fnm430" id="fnm430"></a>Numisius.<a href="#fn430" class="fnnum">430</a> By diminishing the hope of
pardon they tried to cement their bond of crime.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap71" id="IVchap71"></a><span class="chapnum">71</span>Such was the position when Petilius Cerialis reached Mainz.
His arrival roused high hopes. He was himself thirsting for battle,
and being always better at despising his enemy than at taking
precautions, he fired his men by delivering a spirited harangue,
promising that directly there was a chance of getting into touch
with the enemy he would engage without delay. He dismissed the
Gallic recruits to their homes with a message that the legions were
enough for his task: the allies could resume their peaceful
occupations, feeling assured that the war was practically ended, now
that Roman troops had taken it in hand. This action rendered the
Gauls all the more tractable. They made less difficulty about the
war-tax, now that they had got their men back again, while his
disdain only sharpened their sense of duty. On the other side, when
Civilis and Classicus heard of Tutor's defeat, the destruction of
the Treviri, and the universal success of the Roman arms, they fell
into a panic, hastily mobilized their own scattered forces, and kept
sending messages to Valentinus not to risk a decisive battle. This
only hastened Cerialis' movements. He sent <a name="page184" id="page184" ></a><span class="pagenum">184</span>guides to the legions
stationed in the country of the Mediomatrici to lead them by the
shortest route on the enemy's rear. Then, assembling all the troops
to be found in <a name="fnm431" id="fnm431"></a>Mainz<a href="#fn431" class="fnnum">431</a> together with his own force, he marched in
three days to <a name="fnm432" id="fnm432"></a>Rigodulum.<a href="#fn432" class="fnnum">432</a> Here, on a spot protected by the
mountains on one side and the Moselle on the other, Valentinus had
already taken his stand with a large force of Treviri. His camp had
been strengthened with trenches and stone barricades, but these
fortifications had no terrors for the Roman general. He ordered the
infantry to force the position in front, while the cavalry were to
ascend the hill. Valentinus' hurriedly assembled forces filled him
with contempt, for he knew that whatever advantage their position
might give them, the superior morale of his men would outweigh it. A
short delay was necessary while the cavalry climbed the hill,
exposed to the enemy's fire. But when the fight began, the Treviri
tumbled headlong down the hill like a house falling. Some of our
cavalry, who had ridden round by an easier gradient, captured
several Belgic chieftains, including their general, Valentinus.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap72" id="IVchap72"></a><span class="chapnum">72</span>On the next day Cerialis entered Trier. The troops
clamoured greedily for its destruction. 'It was the native town of
Classicus and of Tutor: these were the men who had wickedly
entrapped and slaughtered the legions. Its guilt was far worse than
that of Cremona, which had been wiped off the face of Italy <a name="page185" id="page185" ></a><span class="pagenum">185</span>for
causing the victors a single night's delay. Was the chief seat of
the rebellion to be left standing untouched on the German frontier,
glorying in the spoil of Roman armies and the blood of Roman
generals?<a name="fnm433" id="fnm433"></a><a href="#fn433" class="fnnum">433</a> The plunder could go to the Imperial Treasury. It
would be enough for them to see the rebel town in smoking ruins;
that would be some compensation for the destruction of so many
camps.' Cerialis was afraid of soiling his reputation if it was said
that he gave his men a taste for cruelty and riot, so he suppressed
their indignation. They obeyed him, too, for now that civil war was
done with, there was less insubordination on foreign service. Their
thoughts were now distracted by the pitiful plight of the legions
who had been summoned from the country of the <a name="fnm434" id="fnm434"></a>Mediomatrici.<a href="#fn434" class="fnnum">434</a>
Miserably conscious of their guilt, they stood with eyes rooted to
the ground. When the armies met, they raised no cheer: they had no
answer for those who offered comfort and encouragement: they skulked
in their tents, shunning the light of day. It was not fear of
punishment so much as the shame of their disgrace which thus
overwhelmed them. Even the victorious army showed their
bewilderment: hardly venturing to make an audible petition, they
craved pardon for them with silent tears. At length Cerialis soothed
their alarm. He insisted that all disasters due to dissension
between officers and men, or to the enemy's guile, were to be
regarded as 'acts <a name="page186" id="page186" ></a><span class="pagenum">186</span>of destiny'. They were to count this as their
first day of service and sworn <a name="fnm435" id="fnm435"></a>allegiance.<a href="#fn435" class="fnnum">435</a> Neither he nor the
emperor would remember past misdeeds. He then gave them quarters in
his own camp, and sent round orders that no one in the heat of any
quarrel should taunt a fellow soldier with mutiny or defeat.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap73" id="IVchap73"></a><span class="chapnum">73</span>Cerialis next summoned the Treviri and Lingones, and
addressed them as follows: 'Unpractised as I am in public speaking,
for it is only on the field that I have asserted the superiority of
Rome, yet since words have so much weight with you, and since you
distinguish good and bad not by the light of facts but by what
agitators tell you, I have decided to make a few remarks, which, as
the war is practically over, are likely to be more profitable to the
audience than to ourselves. Roman generals and officers originally
set foot in your country and the rest of Gaul from no motives of
ambition, but at the call of your ancestors, who were worn almost to
ruin by dissension. The Germans whom one party summoned to their aid
had forced the yoke of slavery on allies and enemies alike. You know
how often we fought against the Cimbri and the Teutons, with what
infinite pains and with what striking success our armies have
undertaken German wars. All that is notorious. And to-day it is not
to protect Italy that we have occupied the Rhine, but to prevent
some second Ariovistus making himself <a name="page187" id="page187" ></a><span class="pagenum">187</span>master of All <a name="fnm436" id="fnm436"></a>Gaul.<a href="#fn436" class="fnnum">436</a> Do
you imagine that Civilis and his Batavi and the other tribes across
the Rhine care any more about you than their ancestors cared about
your fathers and grandfathers? The Germans have always had the same
motives for trespassing into Gaul&mdash;their greed for gain and their
desire to change homes with you. They wanted to leave their marshes
and deserts, and to make themselves masters of this magnificently
fertile soil and of you who live on it. Of course they use specious
pretexts and talk about liberty. No one has ever wanted to enslave
others and play the tyrant without making use of the very same
phrases.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap74" id="IVchap74"></a><span class="chapnum">74</span>'Tyranny and warfare were always rife throughout the length
and breadth of Gaul, until you accepted Roman government. Often as
we have been provoked, we have never imposed upon you any burden by
right of conquest, except what was necessary to maintain peace.
Tribes cannot be kept quiet without troops. You cannot have troops
without pay; and you cannot raise pay without taxation. In every
other respect you are treated as our equals. You frequently command
our legions yourselves: you govern this and other provinces
yourselves. We have no exclusive privileges. Though you live so far
away, you enjoy the blessings of a good emperor no less than we do,
<a name="page188" id="page188" ></a><span class="pagenum">188</span>whereas the tyrant only oppresses his nearest neighbours. You must
put up with luxury and greed in your masters, just as you put up
with bad crops or excessive rain, or any other natural disaster.
Vice will last as long as mankind. But these evils are not
continual. There are intervals of good government, which make up for
them. You cannot surely hope that the tyranny of Tutor and Classicus
would mean milder government, or that they will need less taxation
for the armies they will have to raise to keep the Germans and
Britons at bay. For if the Romans were driven out&mdash;which Heaven
forbid&mdash;what could ensue save a universal state of intertribal
warfare? During eight hundred years, by good fortune and good
organization, the structure of empire has been consolidated. It
cannot be pulled down without destroying those who do it. And it is
you who would run the greatest risk of all, since you have gold and
rich resources, which are the prime causes of war. You must learn,
then, to love and foster peace and the city of Rome in which you,
the vanquished, have the same rights as your conquerors. You have
tried both conditions. Take warning, then, that submission and
safety are better than rebellion and ruin.' By such words as these
he quieted and reassured his audience, who had been afraid of more
rigorous measures.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap75" id="IVchap75"></a><span class="chapnum">75</span>While the victors were occupying Trier, Civilis and
Classicus sent a letter to Cerialis, the gist of which was that
Vespasian was dead, though the news was being suppressed: Rome and
Italy were exhausted by civil <a name="page189" id="page189" ></a><span class="pagenum">189</span>war: Mucianus and Domitian were mere
names with no power behind them: if Cerialis desired to be emperor
of All Gaul, they would be satisfied with their own territory: but
if he should prefer battle, that, too, they would not deny him.
Cerialis made no answer to Civilis and Classicus, but sent the
letter and its bearer to Domitian.</p>

<p>The enemy now approached Trier from every quarter in detached bands,
and Cerialis was much criticized for allowing them to unite, when he
might have cut them off one by one. The Roman army now threw a
trench and rampart round their camp, for they had rashly settled in
it without seeing to the fortifications. <a name="IVchap76" id="IVchap76"></a><span class="chapnum">76</span>In the German camp
different opinions were being keenly debated. Civilis contended that
they should wait for the tribes from across the Rhine, whose arrival
would spread a panic sufficient to crush the enfeebled forces of the
Romans. The Gauls, he urged, were simply a prey for the winning side
and, as it was, the Belgae, who were their sole strength, had
declared for him or were at least sympathetic. Tutor maintained that
delay only strengthened the Roman force, since their armies were
converging from every quarter. 'They have brought one legion across
from Britain, others have been summoned from Spain, or are on their
way from <a name="fnm437" id="fnm437"></a>Italy.<a href="#fn437" class="fnnum">437</a> Nor are they raw recruits, but experienced
veterans, while the Germans, on whose aid we rely, are subject to no
discipline or control, but do whatever they like. You can only
<a name="page190" id="page190" ></a><span class="pagenum">190</span>bribe them with presents of money, and the Romans have the
advantage of us there: besides, however keen to fight, a man always
prefers peace to danger, so long as the pay is the same. But if we
engage them at once, Cerialis has nothing but the remnants of the
German <a name="fnm438" id="fnm438"></a>army,<a href="#fn438" class="fnnum">438</a> who have sworn allegiance to the Gallic Empire.
The very fact that they have just won an unexpected victory over
Valentinus' undisciplined <a name="fnm439" id="fnm439"></a>bands<a href="#fn439" class="fnnum">439</a> serves to confirm them and
their general in imprudence. They will venture out again and will
fall, not into the hands of an inexperienced boy, who knows more
about making speeches than war, but into the hands of Civilis and
Classicus, at the sight of whom they will recall their fears and
their flights and their famine, and remember how often they have had
to beg their lives from their captors. Nor, again, is it any liking
for the Romans that keeps back the Treviri and Lingones: they will
fly to arms again, when once their fears are dispelled.' Classicus
finally settled the difference of opinion by declaring for Tutor's
policy, and they promptly proceeded to carry it out.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap77" id="IVchap77"></a><span class="chapnum">77</span>The Ubii and Lingones were placed in the centre, the
Batavian cohorts on the right, and on the left the Bructeri and
Tencteri. Advancing, some by the hills and some by the path between
the road and the <a name="fnm440" id="fnm440"></a>river,<a href="#fn440" class="fnnum">440</a>
<a name="page191" id="page191" ></a><span class="pagenum">191</span> they took us completely by surprise.
So sudden was their onslaught that Cerialis, who had not spent the
night in camp, was still in bed when he heard almost simultaneously
that the fighting had begun and that the day was lost. He cursed the
messengers for their cowardice until he saw the whole extent of the
disaster with his own eyes. The camp had been forced, the cavalry
routed, and the bridge over the Moselle, leading to the outskirts of
the town, which lay between him and his army,<a href="#fn440" class="fnnum">440</a> was held by the
enemy. But confusion had no terrors for Cerialis. Seizing hold on
fugitives, flinging himself without any armour into the thick of the
fire, he succeeded by his inspired imprudence and the assistance of
the braver men in retaking the bridge. Leaving a picked band to hold
it, he hurried back to the camp, where he found that the companies
of the legions which had surrendered at Bonn and <a name="fnm441" id="fnm441"></a>Novaesium<a href="#fn441" class="fnnum">441</a> were
all broken up, few men were left at their posts, and the eagles were
all but surrounded by the enemy. He turned on them in blazing anger,
'It is not Flaccus or Vocula that you are deserting. There is no
"treason" about me. I have done nothing to be ashamed of, except
that I was rash enough to believe that you had forgotten your Gallic
ties and awakened to the memory of your Roman allegiance. Am I to be
numbered with<a name="page192" id="page192" ></a><span class="pagenum">192</span> Numisius and <a name="fnm442" id="fnm442"></a>Herennius?<a href="#fn442" class="fnnum">442</a> Then you can say that
all your generals have fallen either by your hands or the enemy's.
Go and tell the news to Vespasian, or rather, to Civilis and
Classicus&mdash;they are nearer at hand&mdash;that you have deserted your
general on the field of battle. There will yet come legions who will
not leave me unavenged or you unpunished.'</p>

<p><a name="IVchap78" id="IVchap78"></a><span class="chapnum">78</span>All he said was true, and the other officers heaped the
same reproaches on their heads. The men were drawn up in cohorts and
companies, since it was impossible to deploy with the enemy swarming
round them, and, the fight being inside the rampart, the tents and
baggage were a serious encumbrance. Tutor and Classicus and Civilis,
each at his post, were busy rallying their forces, appealing to the
Gauls to fight for freedom, the Batavians for glory, and the Germans
for plunder. Everything, indeed, went well for the enemy until the
Twenty-first legion, who had rallied in a clearer space than any of
the others, first sustained their charge and then repulsed them.
Then, by divine providence, on the very point of victory the enemy
suddenly lost their nerve and turned tail. They themselves
attributed their panic to the appearance of the Roman auxiliaries,
who, after being scattered by the first charge, formed again on the
hill-tops and were taken for fresh reinforcements. However, what
really cost the Gauls their victory was that they let their enemy
alone and indulged in ignoble squabbles over the spoil. Thus after
Cerialis' carelessness had <a name="page193" id="page193" ></a><span class="pagenum">193</span>almost caused disaster, his pluck now
saved the day, and he followed up his success by capturing the
enemy's camp and destroying it before nightfall.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap79" id="IVchap79"></a><span class="chapnum">79</span>Cerialis' troops were allowed short respite. Cologne was
clamouring for help and offering to surrender Civilis' wife and
sister and Classicus' daughter, who had been left behind there as
pledges of the alliance. In the meantime the inhabitants had
massacred all the stray Germans to be found in the town. They were
now alarmed at this, and had good reason to implore aid before the
enemy should recover their strength and bethink themselves of
victory, or at any rate of revenge. Indeed, Civilis already had
designs on Cologne, and he was still formidable, for the most
warlike of his cohorts, composed of Chauci and <a name="fnm443" id="fnm443"></a>Frisii,<a href="#fn443" class="fnnum">443</a> was
still in full force at <a name="fnm444" id="fnm444"></a>Tolbiacum,<a href="#fn444" class="fnnum">444</a> within the territory of
Cologne. However, he changed his plans on receiving the bitter news
that this force had been entrapped and destroyed by the inhabitants
of Cologne. They had entertained them at a lavish banquet, drugged
them with wine, shut the doors upon them and burned the place to the
ground. At the same moment Cerialis came by forced marches to the
relief of Cologne. A further anxiety haunted Civilis. He was afraid
that the Fourteenth legion, in conjunction with the fleet from
Britain,<a name="fnm445" id="fnm445"></a><a href="#fn445" class="fnnum">445</a> might harry <a name="page194" id="page194" ></a><span class="pagenum">194</span>the Batavian coast. However, Fabius
Priscus, who was in command, led his troops inland into the country
of the Nervii and Tungri, who surrendered to him. The
<a name="fnm446" id="fnm446"></a>Canninefates<a href="#fn446" class="fnnum">446</a> made an unprovoked attack upon the fleet and sank
or captured the greater number of the ships. They also defeated a
band of Nervian volunteers who had been recruited in the Roman
interest. Classicus secured a further success against an
advance-guard of cavalry which Cerialis had sent forward to
Novaesium. These repeated checks, though unimportant in themselves,
served to dim the lustre of the recent Roman <a name="fnm447" id="fnm447"></a>victory.<a href="#fn447" class="fnnum">447</a></p>

<h3><a name="Events" id="Events"></a>Events in Rome and in the East</h3>

<p><a name="IVchap80" id="IVchap80"></a><span class="chapnum">80</span>It was about this time that Mucianus gave orders for the
murder of Vitellius' <a name="fnm448" id="fnm448"></a>son,<a href="#fn448" class="fnnum">448</a> on the plea that dissension would
continue until all the seeds of war were stamped out. He also
refused to allow Antonius Primus to go out on Domitian's staff,
being alarmed at his popularity among the troops and at the man's
own vanity, which would brook no equal, much less a superior.
Antonius accordingly went to join Vespasian, whose reception, though
not hostile, proved a disappointment. The emperor was drawn two
ways. On the one side were Antonius' services: it was undeniable
that his generalship had ended the war. In the other scale were
Mucianus' letters. Besides <a name="page195" id="page195" ></a><span class="pagenum">195</span>which, every one else seemed ready to
rake up the scandals of his past life and inveigh against his vanity
and bad temper. Antonius himself did his best to provoke hostility
by expatiating to excess on his services, decrying the other
generals as incompetent cowards, and stigmatizing Caecina as a
prisoner who had surrendered. Thus without any open breach of
friendship he gradually declined lower and lower in the emperor's
favour.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap81" id="IVchap81"></a><span class="chapnum">81</span>During the months which Vespasian spent at Alexandria
waiting for the regular season of the summer <a name="fnm449" id="fnm449"></a>winds<a href="#fn449" class="fnnum">449</a> to ensure a
safe voyage, there occurred many miraculous events manifesting the
goodwill of Heaven and the special favour of Providence towards him.
At Alexandria a poor workman who was well known to have a disease of
the eye, acting on the advice of Serapis, whom this superstitious
people worship as their chief god, fell at Vespasian's feet
demanding with sobs a cure for his blindness, and imploring that the
emperor would deign to moisten his eyes and eyeballs with the
spittle from his mouth. Another man with a maimed hand, also
inspired by Serapis, besought Vespasian to imprint his footmark on
it. At first Vespasian laughed at them and refused. But they
insisted. Half fearing to be thought a fool, half stirred to hopes
by their petition and by the flattery of his courtiers, he
eventually told the doctors to form an opinion whether such cases of
blindness and deformity <a name="page196" id="page196" ></a><span class="pagenum">196</span>could be remedied by human aid. The doctors
talked round the question, saying that in the one case the power of
sight was not extinct and would return, if certain impediments were
removed; in the other case the limbs were distorted and could be set
right again by the application of an effective remedy: this might be
the will of Heaven and the emperor had perhaps been chosen as the
divine instrument. They added that he would gain all the credit, if
the cure were successful, while, if it failed, the ridicule would
fall on the unfortunate patients. This convinced Vespasian that
there were no limits to his destiny: nothing now seemed incredible.
To the great excitement of the bystanders, he stepped forward with a
smile on his face and did as the men desired him. Immediately the
hand recovered its functions and daylight shone once more in the
blind man's eyes. Those who were present still attest both miracles
to-day,<a name="fnm450" id="fnm450"></a><a href="#fn450" class="fnnum">450</a> when there is nothing to gain by lying.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap82" id="IVchap82"></a><span class="chapnum">82</span>This occurrence deepened Vespasian's desire to visit the
holy-place and consult Serapis about the fortunes of the empire. He
gave orders that no one else was to be allowed in the temple, and
then went in. While absorbed in his devotions, he suddenly saw
behind him an Egyptian noble, named Basilides, whom he knew to be
lying ill several days' journey from Alexandria. He inquired of the
priests whether Basilides had entered the temple that day. He
inquired of every one he met whether he had been seen in the city.
Even<a name="page197" id="page197" ></a><span class="pagenum">197</span>tually he sent some horsemen, who discovered that at the time
Basilides was eighty miles away. Vespasian therefore took what he
had seen for a divine apparition, and guessed the meaning of the
oracle from the name 'Basilides'.<a name="fnm451" id="fnm451"></a><a href="#fn451" class="fnnum">451</a></p>

<p><a name="IVchap83" id="IVchap83"></a><span class="chapnum">83</span>The origins of the god Serapis are not given in any Roman
authorities. The high-priests of Egypt give the following account:
King Ptolemy, who was the first of the Macedonians to put the power
of Egypt on a firm <a name="fnm452" id="fnm452"></a>footing,<a href="#fn452" class="fnnum">452</a> was engaged in building walls and
temples, and instituting religious cults for his newly founded city
of Alexandria, when there appeared to him in his sleep a young man
of striking beauty and supernatural stature, who warned him to send
his most faithful friends to Pontus to fetch his image. After adding
that this would bring luck to the kingdom, and that its
resting-place would grow great and famous, he appeared to be taken
up into heaven in a sheet of flame. Impressed by this miraculous
prophecy, Ptolemy revealed his vision to the priests of Egypt, who
are used to interpreting such things. As they had but little
knowledge of Pontus or of foreign cults, he consulted an Athenian
named Timotheus, a member of the Eumolpid <a name="fnm453" id="fnm453"></a>clan,<a href="#fn453" class="fnnum">453</a> whom he had
brought over from Eleusis to be overseer of <a name="page198" id="page198" ></a><span class="pagenum">198</span>religious ceremonies,
and asked him what worship and what god could possibly be meant.
Timotheus found some people who had travelled in Pontus and learnt
from them, that near a town called Sinope there was a temple, which
had long been famous in the neighbourhood as the seat of
Jupiter-Pluto,<a name="fnm454" id="fnm454"></a><a href="#fn454" class="fnnum">454</a> and near it there also stood a female figure,
which was commonly called Proserpine. Ptolemy was like most despots,
easily terrified at first, but liable, when his panic was over, to
think more of his pleasures than of his religious duties. The
incident was gradually forgotten, and other thoughts occupied his
mind until the vision was repeated in a more terrible and impressive
form than before, and he was threatened with death and the
destruction of his kingdom if he failed to fulfil his instructions.
He at once gave orders that representatives should be sent with
presents to King Scydrothemis, who was then reigning at Sinope, and
on their departure he instructed them to consult the oracle of
Apollo at Delphi. They made a successful voyage and received a clear
answer from the oracle: they were to go and bring back the image of
Apollo's father but leave his sister's behind.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap84" id="IVchap84"></a><span class="chapnum">84</span>On their arrival at Sinope they laid their presents, their
petition, and their king's instructions before Scydrothemis. He was
in some perplexity. He was afraid of the god and yet alarmed by the
threats of his subjects, who opposed the project: then, again, he
often felt tempted by the envoys' presents and <a name="page199" id="page199" ></a><span class="pagenum">199</span>promises. Three
years passed. Ptolemy's zeal never abated for a moment. He persisted
in his petition, and kept sending more and more distinguished
envoys, more ships, more gold. Then a threatening vision appeared to
Scydrothemis, bidding him no longer thwart the god's design. When he
still hesitated, he was beset by every kind of disease and disaster:
the gods were plainly angry and their hand was heavier upon him
every day. He summoned an assembly and laid before it the divine
commands, his own and Ptolemy's visions, and the troubles with which
they were visited. The king found the people unfavourable. They were
jealous of Egypt and fearful of their own future. So they surged
angrily round the temple. The story now grows stranger still. The
god himself, it says, embarked unaided on one of the ships that lay
beached on the shore, and by a miracle accomplished the long
sea-journey and landed at Alexandria within three days. A temple
worthy of so important a city was then built in the quarter called
Rhacotis, on the site of an ancient temple of Serapis and <a name="fnm455" id="fnm455"></a>Isis.<a href="#fn455" class="fnnum">455</a>
This is the most widely accepted account of the god's origin and
arrival. Some people, I am well aware, maintain that the god was
brought from the Syrian town of Seleucia during the <a name="page200" id="page200" ></a><span class="pagenum">200</span>reign of
Ptolemy, the third of that <a name="fnm456" id="fnm456"></a>name.<a href="#fn456" class="fnnum">456</a> Others, again, say it was this
same Ptolemy, but make the place of origin the famous town of
Memphis,<a name="fnm457" id="fnm457"></a><a href="#fn457" class="fnnum">457</a> once the bulwark of ancient Egypt. Many take the god
for Aesculapius, because he cures disease: others for Osiris, the
oldest of the local gods; some, again, for Jupiter, as being the
sovereign lord of the world. But the majority of people, either
judging by what are clearly attributes of the god or by an ingenious
process of conjecture, identify him with Pluto.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap85" id="IVchap85"></a><span class="chapnum">85</span>Domitian and Mucianus were now on their way to the
Alps.<a name="fnm458" id="fnm458"></a><a href="#fn458" class="fnnum">458</a> Before reaching the mountains they received the good news
of the victory over the Treviri, the truth of which was fully
attested by the presence of their leader Valentinus. His courage was
in no way crushed and his face still bore witness to the proud
spirit he had shown. He was allowed a hearing, merely to see what he
was made of, and condemned to death. At his execution some one cast
it in his teeth that his country was conquered, to which he replied,
'Then I am reconciled to death.'</p>

<p>Mucianus now gave utterance to an idea which he had long cherished,
though he pretended it was a sudden inspiration. This was that,
since by Heaven's grace the forces of the enemy had been broken, it
would ill befit Domitian, now that the war was practically <a name="page201" id="page201" ></a><span class="pagenum">201</span>over, to
stand in the way of the other generals to whom the credit belonged.
Were the fortunes of the empire or the safety of Gaul at stake, it
would be right that a Caesar should take the field; the Canninefates
and Batavi might be left to minor generals. So Domitian was to stay
at Lugdunum and there show them the power and majesty of the throne
at close quarters. By abstaining from trifling risks he would be
ready to cope with any greater crisis.</p>

<p><a name="IVchap86" id="IVchap86"></a><span class="chapnum">86</span>The ruse was detected, but it could not be unmasked. That
was part of the courtier's <a name="fnm459" id="fnm459"></a>policy.<a href="#fn459" class="fnnum">459</a> Thus they proceeded to
Lugdunum. From there Domitian is supposed to have sent messengers to
Cerialis to test his loyalty, and to ask whether the general would
transfer his army and his allegiance to him, should he present
himself in person. Whether Domitian's idea was to plan war against
his father or to acquire support against his brother, cannot be
decided, for Cerialis parried his proposal with a salutary snub and
treated it as a boy's day-dream. Realizing that older men despised
his youth, Domitian gave up even those functions of government which
he had hitherto performed. Aping bashfulness and simple tastes, he
hid his feelings under a cloak of impenetrable reserve, professing
literary tastes and a passion for poetry. Thus he concealed his real
self and withdrew from all rivalry with his brother, whose gentler
and altogether different nature he perversely misconstrued.</p>

Serapis was ancient in Egypt. It seems to be suggested that the
arrival of this statue from Pontus did not originate but invigorated
the cult of Serapis. Pluto, Dis, Serapis, are all names for a god of
the underworld. Jupiter seems added vaguely to give more power to
the title. We cannot expect accurate theology from an amateur
antiquarian.</p></div>

<h3><a name="conquest_Judea" id="conquest_Judea"></a>The Conquest of Judaea</h3>


<p><a name="Vchap1" id="Vchap1"></a><span class="chapnum">1</span>Early in this same <a name="fnm460" id="fnm460"></a>year<a href="#fn460" class="fnnum">460</a> Titus Caesar had been entrusted
by his father with the task of completing the reduction of
Judaea.<a name="fnm461" id="fnm461"></a><a href="#fn461" class="fnnum">461</a> While he and his father were both still private
citizens, Titus had distinguished himself as a soldier, and his
reputation for efficiency was steadily increasing, while the
provinces and armies vied with one another in their enthusiasm for
him. Wishing to seem independent of his good fortune, he always
showed dignity and energy in the field. His affability called forth
devotion. He constantly helped in the trenches and could mingle with
his soldiers on the march without compromising his dignity as
general. Three legions awaited him in Judaea, the Fifth, Tenth, and
Fifteenth, all veterans from his father's army. These were
reinforced by the Twelfth from Syria and by detachments of the
Twenty-second and the <a name="fnm462" id="fnm462"></a>Third,<a href="#fn462" class="fnnum">462</a> brought over from Alexandria. This
force was accompanied by twenty auxiliary cohorts and eight
regiments of auxiliary cavalry besides the Kings Agrippa and
Sohaemus, King Antiochus' <a name="fnm463" id="fnm463"></a>irregulars,<a href="#fn463" class="fnnum">463</a> a strong force of Arabs,
who had a neighbourly hatred for the Jews, and a crowd of persons
who had come from Rome and the rest of Italy, each tempted by the
hope of securing <a name="page203" id="page203" ></a><span class="pagenum">203</span>the first place in the prince's still unoccupied
affections. With this force Titus entered the enemy's country at the
head of his column, sending out scouts in all directions, and
holding himself ready to fight. He pitched his camp not far from
Jerusalem.</p>

<p><a name="Vchap2" id="Vchap2"></a><span class="chapnum">2</span>Since I am coming now to describe the last days of this
famous city, it may not seem out of place to recount here its early
history. It is said that the Jews are refugees from <a name="fnm464" id="fnm464"></a>Crete,<a href="#fn464" class="fnnum">464</a> who
settled on the confines of Libya at the time when Saturn was
forcibly deposed by Jupiter. The evidence for this is sought in the
name. Ida is a famous mountain in Crete inhabited by the <a name="fnm465" id="fnm465"></a>Idaei,<a href="#fn465" class="fnnum">465</a>
whose name became lengthened into the foreign form Judaei. Others
say that in the reign of Isis the superfluous population of Egypt,
under the leadership of Hierosolymus and Juda, discharged itself
upon the neighbouring districts, while there are many who think the
Jews an Ethiopian stock, driven to migrate by their fear and dislike
of King <a name="fnm466" id="fnm466"></a>Cepheus.<a href="#fn466" class="fnnum">466</a> Another tradition makes them Assyrian
refugees,<a name="fnm467" id="fnm467"></a><a href="#fn467" class="fnnum">467</a> who, <a name="page204" id="page204" ></a><span class="pagenum">204</span>lacking lands of their own, occupied a district
of Egypt, and later took to building cities of their own and tilling
Hebrew territory and the frontier-land of Syria. Yet another version
assigns to the Jews an illustrious origin as the descendants of the
Solymi&mdash;a tribe famous in <a name="fnm468" id="fnm468"></a>Homer<a href="#fn468" class="fnnum">468</a>&mdash;who founded the city and
called it Hiero<i>solyma</i> after their own <a name="fnm469" id="fnm469"></a>name.<a href="#fn469" class="fnnum">469</a></p>

<p><a name="Vchap3" id="Vchap3"></a><span class="chapnum">3</span>Most authorities agree that a foul and disfiguring disease
once broke out in Egypt, and that King <a name="fnm470" id="fnm470"></a>Bocchoris,<a href="#fn470" class="fnnum">470</a> on
approaching the oracle of Ammon and inquiring for a remedy, was told
to purge his kingdom of the plague and to transport all who suffered
from it into some other country, for they had earned the disfavour
of Heaven. A motley crowd was thus collected and abandoned in the
desert. While all the other outcasts lay idly lamenting, one of
them, named Moses, advised them not to look for help to gods or men,
since both had deserted them, but to trust rather in themselves and
accept as divine the guidance of the first being by whose aid they
should get out of their present plight. They agreed, and set out
blindly to march wherever chance might lead them.<a name="page205" id="page205" ></a><span class="pagenum">205</span> Their worst
distress came from lack of water. When they were already at death's
door and lying prostrate all over the plain, it so happened that a
drove of wild asses moved away from their pasture to a rock densely
covered with trees. Guessing the truth from the grassy nature of the
ground, Moses followed and disclosed an ample flow of <a name="fnm471" id="fnm471"></a>water.<a href="#fn471" class="fnnum">471</a>
This saved them. Continuing their march for six successive days, on
the seventh they routed the natives and gained possession of the
country. There they consecrated their city and their temple.</p>

<p><a name="Vchap4" id="Vchap4"></a><span class="chapnum">4</span>To ensure his future hold over the people, Moses introduced
a new cult, which was the opposite of all other religions. All that
we hold sacred they held profane, and allowed practices which we
abominate. They dedicated in a shrine an image of the <a name="fnm472" id="fnm472"></a>animal<a href="#fn472" class="fnnum">472</a>
whose guidance had put an end to their wandering and thirst. They
killed a ram, apparently as an insult to Ammon, and also sacrificed
a bull, because the Egyptians worship the bull <a name="fnm473" id="fnm473"></a>Apis.<a href="#fn473" class="fnnum">473</a> Pigs are
subject to leprosy; so they abstain from pork in memory of their
misfortune and the foul plague with which they were once infected.
Their frequent <a name="fnm474" id="fnm474"></a>fasts<a href="#fn474" class="fnnum">474</a> bear <a name="page206" id="page206" ></a><span class="pagenum">206</span>witness to the long famine they once
endured, and, in token of the corn they carried off, Jewish bread is
to this day made without leaven. They are said to have devoted the
seventh day to rest, because that day brought an end to their
troubles.<a name="fnm475" id="fnm475"></a><a href="#fn475" class="fnnum">475</a> Later, finding idleness alluring, they gave up the
seventh year as well to <a name="fnm476" id="fnm476"></a>sloth.<a href="#fn476" class="fnnum">476</a> Others maintain that they do
this in honour of Saturn;<a name="fnm477" id="fnm477"></a><a href="#fn477" class="fnnum">477</a> either because their religious
principles are derived from the Idaei, who are supposed to have been
driven out with Saturn and become the ancestors of the Jewish
people; or else because, of the seven constellations which govern
the lives of men, the star of Saturn moves in the topmost orbit and
exercises peculiar influence, and also because most of the heavenly
bodies move <a name="fnm478" id="fnm478"></a>round<a href="#fn478" class="fnnum">478</a> their courses in multiples of seven.</p>

<p><a name="Vchap5" id="Vchap5"></a><span class="chapnum">5</span>Whatever their origin, these rites are sanctioned by their
antiquity. Their other customs are impious and abominable, and owe
their prevalence to their depravity. For all the most worthless
rascals, renouncing their national cults, were always sending money
to swell the sum of offerings and <a name="fnm479" id="fnm479"></a>tribute.<a href="#fn479" class="fnnum">479</a> This is one cause of
Jewish prosperity. Another is that they <a name="page207" id="page207" ></a><span class="pagenum">207</span>are obstinately loyal to
each other, and always ready to show compassion, whereas they feel
nothing but hatred and enmity for the rest of the <a name="fnm480" id="fnm480"></a>world.<a href="#fn480" class="fnnum">480</a> They
eat and sleep separately. Though immoderate in sexual indulgence,
they refrain from all intercourse with foreign women: among
themselves anything is <a name="fnm481" id="fnm481"></a>allowed.<a href="#fn481" class="fnnum">481</a> They have introduced
circumcision to distinguish themselves from other people. Those who
are converted to their customs adopt the same practice, and the
first lessons they learn are to despise the <a name="fnm482" id="fnm482"></a>gods,<a href="#fn482" class="fnnum">482</a> to renounce
their country, and to think nothing of their parents, children, and
brethren. However, they take steps to increase their numbers. They
count it a crime to kill any of their later-born <a name="fnm483" id="fnm483"></a>children,<a href="#fn483" class="fnnum">483</a> and
they believe that the souls of those who die in battle or under
persecution are <a name="fnm484" id="fnm484"></a>immortal.<a href="#fn484" class="fnnum">484</a> Thus they think <a name="page208" id="page208" ></a><span class="pagenum">208</span>much of having
children and nothing of facing death. They prefer to bury and not
burn their <a name="fnm485" id="fnm485"></a>dead.<a href="#fn485" class="fnnum">485</a> In this, as in their burial rites, and in
their belief in an underworld, they conform to Egyptian custom.
Their ideas of heaven are quite different. The Egyptians worship
most of their gods as animals, or in shapes half animal and half
human. The Jews acknowledge one god only, of whom they have a purely
spiritual conception. They think it impious to make images of gods
in human shape out of perishable materials. Their god is almighty
and inimitable, without beginning and without end. They therefore
set up no statues in their temples, nor even in their cities,
refusing this homage both to their own kings and to the Roman
emperors. However, the fact that their priests intoned to the flute
and cymbals and wore wreaths of ivy, and that a golden vine was
found in their <a name="fnm486" id="fnm486"></a>temple<a href="#fn486" class="fnnum">486</a> has led some people to think that they
worship <a name="fnm487" id="fnm487"></a>Bacchus,<a href="#fn487" class="fnnum">487</a> who has so enthralled the East. But their cult
would be most inappropriate. Bacchus instituted gay and cheerful
rites, but the Jewish ritual is preposterous and morbid.</p>

<p><a name="page209" id="page209" ></a><span class="pagenum">209</span><a name="Vchap6" id="Vchap6"></a><span class="chapnum">6</span>The country of the Jews is bounded by Arabia on the east,
by Egypt on the south, and on the west by Phoenicia and the sea. On
the Syrian frontier they have a distant view towards the <a name="fnm488" id="fnm488"></a>north.<a href="#fn488" class="fnnum">488</a>
Physically they are healthy and hardy. Rain is rare; the soil
infertile; its products are of the same kind as ours with the
addition of balsam and palms. The palm is a tall and beautiful tree,
the balsam a mere shrub. When its branches are swollen with sap they
open them with a sharp piece of stone or crockery, for the
sap-vessels shrink up at the touch of iron. The sap is used in
medicine. Lebanon, their chief mountain, stands always deep in its
eternal snow, a strange phenomenon in such a burning climate. Here,
too, the river Jordan has its <a name="fnm489" id="fnm489"></a>source<a href="#fn489" class="fnnum">489</a> and comes pouring down, to
find a home in the sea. It flows undiminished through first one
lake, then another, and loses itself in a <a name="fnm490" id="fnm490"></a>third.<a href="#fn490" class="fnnum">490</a> This last is a
lake of immense size, like a sea, though its water has a foul taste
and a most unhealthy smell, which poisons the surrounding
inhabitants. No wind can stir waves in it: no fish or sea-birds can
live there. The sluggish water supports whatever is thrown on to it,
as if its surface were solid, while those who cannot swim float on
it as easily as those who can. Every year at the same time the lake
yields asphalt. As with other arts, it is experience which shows how
to collect it. It is a black liquid which, when congealed with a
<a name="page210" id="page210" ></a><span class="pagenum">210</span>sprinkling of vinegar, floats on the surface of the water. The men
who collect it take it in this state into their hands and haul it on
deck. Then without further aid it trickles in and loads the boat
until you cut off the stream. But this you cannot do with iron or
brass: the current is turned by applying blood or a garment stained
with a woman's menstrual discharge. That is what the old authorities
say, but those who know the district aver that floating blocks of
asphalt are driven landwards by the wind and dragged to shore by
hand. The steam out of the earth and the heat of the sun dries them,
and they are then split up with axes and wedges, like logs or blocks
of stone.</p>

<p><a name="Vchap7" id="Vchap7"></a><span class="chapnum">7</span>Not far from this lake are the Plains, which they say were
once fertile and covered with large and populous cities which were
destroyed by <a name="fnm491" id="fnm491"></a>lightning.<a href="#fn491" class="fnnum">491</a> Traces of the cities are said to
remain, and the ground, which looks scorched, has lost all power of
production. The plants, whether wild or artificially cultivated, are
blighted and sterile and wither into dust and ashes, either when in
leaf or flower, or when they have attained their full growth.
Without denying that at some date famous cities were there burnt up
by lightning, I am yet inclined to think that it is the exhalation
from the lake which infects the soil and poisons the surrounding
atmosphere. Soil and climate being equally deleterious, the crops
and fruits all rot away.</p>

<p><a name="page211" id="page211" ></a><span class="pagenum">211</span>The river Belus also falls into this Jewish sea. Round its mouth is
found a peculiar kind of sand which is mixed with native soda and
smelted into glass. Small though the beach is, its product is
inexhaustible.</p>

<p><a name="Vchap8" id="Vchap8"></a><span class="chapnum">8</span>The greater part of the population live in scattered
villages, but they also have towns. Jerusalem is the Jewish capital,
and contained the temple, which was enormously wealthy. A first line
of fortifications guarded the city, another the palace, and an
innermost line enclosed the <a name="fnm492" id="fnm492"></a>temple.<a href="#fn492" class="fnnum">492</a> None but a Jew was allowed
as far as the doors: none but the priests might cross the
threshold.<a name="fnm493" id="fnm493"></a><a href="#fn493" class="fnnum">493</a> When the East was in the hands of the Assyrians,
Medes and Persians, they regarded the Jews as the meanest of their
slaves. During the Macedonian <a name="fnm494" id="fnm494"></a>ascendancy<a href="#fn494" class="fnnum">494</a> King <a name="fnm495" id="fnm495"></a>Antiochus<a href="#fn495" class="fnnum">495</a>
endeavoured to abolish their superstitions and to introduce Greek
manners and customs. But Arsaces at that moment <a name="fnm496" id="fnm496"></a>rebelled,<a href="#fn496" class="fnnum">496</a> and
the Parthian war prevented him from effecting any improvement in the
character of this grim people. Then, when Macedon waned, as the
Parthian power was not yet ripe and Rome was <a name="page212" id="page212" ></a><span class="pagenum">212</span>still far away, they
took kings of their <a name="fnm497" id="fnm497"></a>own.<a href="#fn497" class="fnnum">497</a> The mob were fickle and drove them
out. However, they recovered their throne by force; banished their
countrymen, sacked cities, slew their brothers, wives, and parents,
and committed all the usual kingly crimes. But this only fostered
the hold of the Jewish religion, since the kings had strengthened
their authority by assuming the priesthood.</p>

<p><a name="Vchap9" id="Vchap9"></a><span class="chapnum">9</span>Cnaeus Pompeius was the first Roman to subdue the Jews and
set foot in their temple by right of <a name="fnm498" id="fnm498"></a>conquest.<a href="#fn498" class="fnnum">498</a> It was then
first realized that the temple contained no image of any god: their
sanctuary was empty, their mysteries meaningless. The walls of
Jerusalem were destroyed, but the temple was left standing. Later,
during the Roman civil wars, when the eastern provinces had come
under the control of Mark Antony, the Parthian Prince Pacorus seized
Judaea,<a name="fnm499" id="fnm499"></a><a href="#fn499" class="fnnum">499</a> and was killed by Publius Ventidius. The Parthians were
driven back over the Euphrates, and Caius <a name="fnm500" id="fnm500"></a>Sosius<a href="#fn500" class="fnnum">500</a> subdued the
Jews. Antony gave the kingdom to <a name="fnm501" id="fnm501"></a>Herod,<a href="#fn501" class="fnnum">501</a> and Augustus, after his
victory, enlarged it. After Herod's death, somebody called<a name="page213" id="page213" ></a><span class="pagenum">213</span>
Simon,<a name="fnm502" id="fnm502"></a><a href="#fn502" class="fnnum">502</a> without awaiting the emperor's decision, forcibly
assumed the title of king. He was executed by Quintilius Varus, who
was Governor of Syria; the Jews were repressed and the kingdom
divided between three of Herod's <a name="fnm503" id="fnm503"></a>sons.<a href="#fn503" class="fnnum">503</a> Under Tiberius all was
quiet. Caligula ordered them to put up his statue in the temple.
They preferred war to that. But Caligula's death put an end to the
rising.<a name="fnm504" id="fnm504"></a><a href="#fn504" class="fnnum">504</a> In Claudius' reign the kings had all either died or
lost most of their territory. The emperor therefore made Judaea a
province to be governed by Roman knights or freedmen. One of these,
Antonius <a name="fnm505" id="fnm505"></a>Felix,<a href="#fn505" class="fnnum">505</a> indulged in every kind of cruelty and
immorality, wielding a king's authority with all the instincts of a
slave. He had married Drusilla, a granddaughter of Antony and
Cleopatra, so that he was Antony's grandson-in-law, while Claudius
was Antony's <a name="fnm506" id="fnm506"></a>grandson.<a href="#fn506" class="fnnum">506</a></p>

<p><a name="Vchap10" id="Vchap10"></a><span class="chapnum">10</span>The Jews endured such oppression patiently until the time
of Gessius <a name="fnm507" id="fnm507"></a>Florus,<a href="#fn507" class="fnnum">507</a> under whom war broke out. Cestius Gallus,
the Governor of Syria, tried to crush it, but met with more reverses
than victories. He died, either in the natural course or perhaps of
disgust, and Nero sent out Vespasian, who, in a couple of
campaigns,<a name="fnm508" id="fnm508"></a><a href="#fn508" class="fnnum">508</a> thanks to his reputation, good fortune, and able
subordinates, had the whole of the country <a name="page214" id="page214" ></a><span class="pagenum">214</span>districts and all the
towns except Jerusalem under the heel of his victorious army. The
next <a name="fnm509" id="fnm509"></a>year<a href="#fn509" class="fnnum">509</a> was taken up with civil war, and passed quietly
enough as far as the Jews were concerned. But peace once restored in
Italy, foreign troubles began again with feelings embittered on our
side by the thought that the Jews were the only people who had not
given in. At the same time it seemed best to leave Titus at the head
of the army to meet the eventualities of the new reign, whether good
or bad.</p>

<p><a name="Vchap11" id="Vchap11"></a><span class="chapnum">11</span>Thus, as we have already <a name="fnm510" id="fnm510"></a>seen,<a href="#fn510" class="fnnum">510</a> Titus pitched his camp
before the walls of Jerusalem and proceeded to display his legions
in battle order. The Jews formed up at the foot of their own walls,
ready, if successful, to venture further, but assured of their
retreat in case of reverse. A body of cavalry and some light-armed
foot were sent forward, and fought an indecisive engagement, from
which the enemy eventually retired. During the next few days a
series of skirmishes took place in front of the gates, and at last
continual losses drove the Jews behind their walls. The Romans then
determined to take it by storm. It seemed undignified to sit and
wait for the enemy to starve, and the men all clamoured for the
risks, some being really brave, while many others were wild and
greedy for plunder. Titus himself had the vision of Rome with all
her wealth and pleasures before his eyes, and felt that their
enjoyment was postponed unless Jerusalem fell at once. The city,
however, stands high and is <a name="page215" id="page215" ></a><span class="pagenum">215</span>fortified with works strong enough to
protect a city standing on the plain. Two enormous <a name="fnm511" id="fnm511"></a>hills<a href="#fn511" class="fnnum">511</a> were
surrounded by walls ingeniously built so as to project or slope
inwards and thus leave the flanks of an attacking party exposed to
fire. The rocks were jagged at the top. The towers, where the rising
ground helped, were sixty feet high, and in the hollows as much as a
hundred and twenty. They are a wonderful sight and seem from a
distance to be all of equal height. Within this runs another line of
fortification surrounding the palace, and on a conspicuous height
stands the Antonia, a castle named by Herod in honour of Mark
Antony.</p>

<p><a name="Vchap12" id="Vchap12"></a><span class="chapnum">12</span>The temple was built like a citadel with walls of its own,
on which more care and labour had been spent than on any of the
others. Even the cloisters surrounding the temple formed a splendid
rampart. There was a never-failing spring of <a name="fnm512" id="fnm512"></a>water,<a href="#fn512" class="fnnum">512</a> catacombs
hollowed out of the hills, and pools or cisterns for holding the
rain-water. Its original builders had foreseen that the
peculiarities of Jewish life would lead to frequent wars,
consequently everything was ready for the longest of sieges. Besides
this, when Pompey took the city, bitter experience taught them
<a name="page216" id="page216" ></a><span class="pagenum">216</span>several lessons, and in the days of Claudius they had taken
advantage of his avarice to buy rights of fortification, and built
walls in peace-time as though war were imminent. Their numbers were
now swelled by floods of human refuse and unfortunate refugees from
other <a name="fnm513" id="fnm513"></a>towns.<a href="#fn513" class="fnnum">513</a> All the most desperate characters in the country
had taken refuge there, which did not conduce to unity. They had
three armies, each with its own general. The outermost and largest
line of wall was held by Simon; the central city by John, and the
temple by <a name="fnm514" id="fnm514"></a>Eleazar.<a href="#fn514" class="fnnum">514</a> John and Simon were stronger than Eleazar in
numbers and equipment, but he had the advantage of a strong
position. Their relations mainly consisted of fighting, treachery,
and arson: a large quantity of corn was burnt. Eventually, under
pretext of offering a sacrifice, John sent a party of men to
massacre Eleazar and his troops, and by this means gained possession
of the <a name="fnm515" id="fnm515"></a>temple.<a href="#fn515" class="fnnum">515</a> Thus Jerusalem was divided into two hostile
parties, but on the approach of the Romans the necessities of
foreign warfare reconciled their differences.</p>

<p><a name="Vchap13" id="Vchap13"></a><span class="chapnum">13</span>Various portents had occurred at this time, but so sunk in
superstition are the Jews and so opposed to all religious practices
that they think it wicked <a name="page217" id="page217" ></a><span class="pagenum">217</span>to avert the threatened evil by
<a name="fnm516" id="fnm516"></a>sacrifices<a href="#fn516" class="fnnum">516</a> or vows. Embattled armies were seen to meet in the
sky with flashing arms, and the temple shone with sudden fire from
heaven. The doors of the shrine suddenly opened, a supernatural
voice was heard calling the gods out, and at once there began a
mighty movement of departure. Few took alarm at all this. Most
people held the belief that, according to the ancient priestly
writings, this was the moment at which the East was fated to
prevail: they would now start forth from Judaea and conquer the
world.<a name="fnm517" id="fnm517"></a><a href="#fn517" class="fnnum">517</a> This enigmatic prophecy really applied to Vespasian and
Titus. But men are blinded by their hopes. The Jews took to
themselves the promised destiny, and even defeat could not convince
them of the truth. The number of the besieged, men and women of
every age, is stated to have reached six hundred thousand. There
were arms for all who could carry them, and far more were ready to
fight than would be expected from their total numbers. The women
were as determined as the men: if they were forced to leave their
homes they had more to fear in life than in death.</p>

<p>Such was the city and such the people with which<a name="page218" id="page218" ></a><span class="pagenum">218</span> Titus was faced.
As the nature of the ground forbade a sudden assault, he determined
to employ siege-works and penthouse shelters. The work was
accordingly divided among the legions, and there was a truce to
fighting until they had got ready every means of storming a town
that had ever been devised by experience or inventive ingenuity.</p>

<h3><a name="End_Revolt" id="End_Revolt"></a>The End of the German Revolt</h3>

<p><a name="Vchap14" id="Vchap14"></a><span class="chapnum">14</span>After the severe reverse at <a name="fnm518" id="fnm518"></a>Trier<a href="#fn518" class="fnnum">518</a> Civilis recruited
his army in Germany, and pitched his camp near Vetera. The position
was a safe one, and he hoped to inspirit his native troops with the
memory of their former victories <a name="fnm519" id="fnm519"></a>there.<a href="#fn519" class="fnnum">519</a> Cerialis followed in
his footsteps, with forces now doubled by the arrival of the
Second,<a name="fnm520" id="fnm520"></a><a href="#fn520" class="fnnum">520</a> Thirteenth, and Fourteenth legions, besides auxiliary
troops, both horse and <a name="fnm521" id="fnm521"></a>foot,<a href="#fn521" class="fnnum">521</a> who had long received their
summons and came hurrying on the news of victory. Neither general
was dilatory, but a vast plain lay between them. It was by nature
swampy, and Civilis had built a dam projecting into the Rhine, which
stemmed the current and flooded the adjacent fields. The treacherous
nature of the ground, where the shallows were hard to find, told
against our men, who were heavily armed and afraid <a name="page219" id="page219" ></a><span class="pagenum">219</span>of swimming. The
Germans, on the other hand, were used to rivers, lightly armed, and
tall enough to keep their heads above water.</p>

<p><a name="Vchap15" id="Vchap15"></a><span class="chapnum">15</span>Provoked by the Batavi, the bravest of our troops opened
the engagement at once, but soon fell into a panic when their arms
and horses began to sink in the deep marshes. The Germans, who knew
the fords, came leaping across them, often leaving our front alone
and running round to the flanks or the rear. It was not like an
infantry engagement at close quarters, but more like a naval battle.
The men floundered about in the water or, finding firm foothold,
strove with all their might for possession of it. Thus, wounded and
whole, those who could swim and those who could not, struggled
helplessly with each other and perished all alike. However,
considering the confusion, our loss was less than might have been
expected, for the Germans, not daring to venture out of the marsh,
withdrew to their camp. The result of this engagement gave each of
the generals a different motive for hastening on a decisive battle.
Civilis wanted to follow up his success, Cerialis to wipe out his
disgrace. Success stimulated the pride of the Germans; the Romans
thrilled with shame. The natives spent the night singing
uproariously, while our men muttered angry threats.</p>

<p><a name="Vchap16" id="Vchap16"></a><span class="chapnum">16</span>At daybreak Cerialis formed up his cavalry and the
auxiliary cohorts on his front, with the legions behind them, while
he himself held a picked body in reserve for emergencies. Civilis
did not deploy his line, but <a name="page220" id="page220" ></a><span class="pagenum">220</span>halted them in <a name="fnm522" id="fnm522"></a>columns,<a href="#fn522" class="fnnum">522</a> with the
Batavi and <a name="fnm523" id="fnm523"></a>Cugerni<a href="#fn523" class="fnnum">523</a> on his right, and the forces from across the
<a name="fnm524" id="fnm524"></a>Rhine<a href="#fn524" class="fnnum">524</a> near the river on the left. Neither general followed the
usual custom of haranguing the whole army. They rode along and
addressed their various divisions in turn. Cerialis spoke of the
ancient glory of the Roman name and of all their victories old and
new. He urged them 'to blot out for ever their treacherous and
cowardly enemy whom they had already beaten. They had to punish not
to fight them. They had just fought against superior numbers and had
yet routed the Germans, and, moreover, the pick of their troops.
This remnant had their hearts full of panic and all their wounds
behind them.' He then gave special encouragement to each of the
legions, calling the Fourteenth the conquerors of <a name="fnm525" id="fnm525"></a>Britain,<a href="#fn525" class="fnnum">525</a>
reminding the Sixth that the influence of their example had set
Galba on the <a name="fnm526" id="fnm526"></a>throne,<a href="#fn526" class="fnnum">526</a> and telling the Second that in the coming
fight they would for the first time dedicate their new colours and
their new eagle to Rome's <a name="fnm527" id="fnm527"></a>service.<a href="#fn527" class="fnnum">527</a> Then riding along to the
German <a name="fnm528" id="fnm528"></a>army,<a href="#fn528" class="fnnum">528</a> he pointed with his hand and bade them recover
their own river-bank and their own <a name="fnm529" id="fnm529"></a>camp<a href="#fn529" class="fnnum">529</a> at the enemy's expense.
They all cheered with hearts the lighter for his words. Some longed
for <a name="page221" id="page221" ></a><span class="pagenum">221</span>battle after a long spell of quiet: others were weary of war
and pined for peace, hoping that the future would bring them rest
and recompense.</p>

<p><a name="Vchap17" id="Vchap17"></a><span class="chapnum">17</span>Nor was there silence in Civilis' lines. As he formed them
up he appealed to the spot as evidence of their valour. The Germans
and Batavians were standing, he told them, 'on the field of their
glory, trampling the charred bones of Roman soldiers under foot.
Wherever the Romans turned their eyes they saw nothing but menacing
reminders of surrender and defeat. They must not be alarmed by that
sudden change of fortune in the battle at Trier. It was their own
victory which hampered the Germans there: they had dropped their
weapons and filled their hands with loot. Since then everything had
gone in their favour and against the Romans. He had taken every
possible precaution, as befitted a cunning general. They themselves
were familiar with these soaking plains, but the swamps would be a
deadly trap for the enemy. They had the Rhine and the gods of
Germany before their eyes, and in the might of these they must go to
battle, remembering their wives and parents and their fatherland.
This day would either gild the glory of their ancestors or earn the
execration of posterity.' They applauded his words according to
their custom by dancing and clashing their arms, and then opened the
battle with showers of stones and leaden balls and other missiles,
trying to lure on our men, who had not yet entered the marsh.</p>

<p><a name="Vchap18" id="Vchap18"></a><span class="chapnum">18</span>Their missiles exhausted, the enemy warmed to their work
and made an angry charge. Thanks to their <a name="page222" id="page222" ></a><span class="pagenum">222</span>great height and their
very long spears they could thrust from some distance at our men,
who were floundering and slipping about in the marsh. While this
went on, a <a name="fnm530" id="fnm530"></a>column<a href="#fn530" class="fnnum">530</a> of Batavi swam across from the dam which, as
we described <a name="fnm531" id="fnm531"></a>above,<a href="#fn531" class="fnnum">531</a> had been built out into the Rhine. This
started a panic and the line of our auxiliaries began to be driven
back. Then the legions took up the fight and equalized matters by
staying the enemy's wild charge. Meanwhile a Batavian deserter
approached Cerialis, avowing that he could take the enemy in the
rear if the cavalry were sent round the edge of the swamp: the
ground was solid there, and the Cugerni, whose task it was to keep
watch, were off their guard. Two squadrons of horse were sent with
the deserter, and succeeded in outflanking the unsuspecting enemy.
The legions in front, when the din told them what had happened,
redoubled their efforts. The Germans were beaten and fled to the
Rhine. This day might have brought the war to an end, had the Roman
<a name="fnm532" id="fnm532"></a>fleet<a href="#fn532" class="fnnum">532</a> arrived in time. As it was, even the cavalry were
prevented from pursuit by a sudden downpour of rain shortly before
nightfall.</p>

<p><a name="Vchap19" id="Vchap19"></a><span class="chapnum">19</span>On the next day the Fourteenth legion were sent to join
Annius <a name="fnm533" id="fnm533"></a>Gallus<a href="#fn533" class="fnnum">533</a> in Upper Germany, and their place in Cerialis'
army was filled by the Tenth from Spain. Civilis was reinforced by
the <a name="fnm534" id="fnm534"></a>Chauci.<a href="#fn534" class="fnnum">534</a> Feeling <a name="page223" id="page223" ></a><span class="pagenum">223</span>that he was not strong enough to hold the
Batavian <a name="fnm535" id="fnm535"></a>capital,<a href="#fn535" class="fnnum">535</a> he took whatever was portable with him, burnt
everything else, and retired into the island. He knew that the
Romans had not enough ships to build a bridge, and that they had no
other means of getting across. He also destroyed the mole built by
Drusus <a name="fnm536" id="fnm536"></a>Germanicus.<a href="#fn536" class="fnnum">536</a> As the bed of the Rhine here falls towards
Gaul, his removal of all obstacles gave it free course; the river
was practically diverted, and the channel between the Germans and
the island became so small and dry as to form no barrier between
them. Tutor and Classicus also crossed the <a name="fnm537" id="fnm537"></a>Rhine,<a href="#fn537" class="fnnum">537</a> together with
a hundred and thirteen town-councillors from Trier, among whom was
Alpinius Montanus, who, as we have already <a name="fnm538" id="fnm538"></a>seen,<a href="#fn538" class="fnnum">538</a> had been sent
by Antonius Primus into Gaul. He was accompanied by his brother. By
arousing sympathy and by offering presents, the others, too, were
all busy raising reinforcements among these eagerly adventurous
tribes.</p>

<p><a name="Vchap20" id="Vchap20"></a><span class="chapnum">20</span>The war was far from being over. Dividing his forces,
Civilis suddenly made a simultaneous attack on all four Roman
garrisons&mdash;the Tenth at Arenacum, the Second at Batavodurum, and the
auxiliary horse and <a name="page224" id="page224" ></a><span class="pagenum">224</span>foot at Grinnes and at <a name="fnm539" id="fnm539"></a>Vada.<a href="#fn539" class="fnnum">539</a> Civilis
himself, Verax his nephew, Classicus and Tutor each led one of the
attacking parties. They could not hope all to be successful, but
reckoned that, if they made several ventures, fortune would probably
favour one or the other. Besides, Cerialis, they supposed, was off
his guard; on receiving news from several places at once he would
hurry from one garrison to another, and might be cut off on his way.
The party told off against the Tenth considered it no light task to
storm a legion, so they fell on the soldiers, who had come outside
to cut timber, and killed the camp-prefect, five senior centurions,
and a handful of the men. The rest defended themselves in the
trenches. Meanwhile another party of Germans endeavoured to break
the <a name="fnm540" id="fnm540"></a>bridge<a href="#fn540" class="fnnum">540</a> which had been begun at Batavodurum, but nightfall
put an end to the battle before it was won.</p>

<p><a name="Vchap21" id="Vchap21"></a><span class="chapnum">21</span>The attack on Grinnes and Vada proved more formidable.
Civilis led the assault on Vada, Classicus on Grinnes. Nothing could
stop them. The bravest of the defenders had fallen, among them,
commanding a cavalry squadron, Briganticus, whom we have seen
already, as a faithful ally of Rome and a bitter enemy of his uncle
Civilis.<a name="fnm541" id="fnm541"></a><a href="#fn541" class="fnnum">541</a> However, when Cerialis came to the rescue with a
picked troop of horse, the tables were turned, and the Germans were
<a name="page225" id="page225" ></a><span class="pagenum">225</span>driven headlong into the river. While Civilis was trying to stop
the rout he was recognized, and finding himself a target, he left
his horse and swam across the river. Verax escaped in the same way,
while some boats put in to fetch Tutor and Classicus.</p>

<p>Even now the Roman fleet had not joined the army. They had, indeed,
received orders, but fear held them back, and the rowers were
employed on various duties elsewhere. It must be admitted, also,
that Cerialis did not give them time enough to carry out his orders.
He was a man of sudden resolves and brilliant successes. Even when
his strategy had failed, good luck always came to his rescue. Thus
neither he nor his army cared much about discipline. A few days
later, again, he narrowly escaped being taken prisoner and did not
escape disgrace. <a name="Vchap22" id="Vchap22"></a><span class="chapnum">22</span>He had gone to Novaesium and Bonn to
inspect the winter quarters that were being built for his legions,
and was returning with the <a name="fnm542" id="fnm542"></a>fleet.<a href="#fn542" class="fnnum">542</a> The Germans noticed that his
<a name="fnm543" id="fnm543"></a>escort<a href="#fn543" class="fnnum">543</a> straggled, and that watch was carelessly kept at night.
So they planned a surprise. Choosing a night black with clouds they
slipped down stream and made their way unmolested into the
camp.<a name="fnm544" id="fnm544"></a><a href="#fn544" class="fnnum">544</a> For the first onslaught they called cunning to their aid.
They cut the tent-ropes and slaughtered the soldiers as they
struggled under their own canvas. Another party fell on the ships,
threw <a name="page226" id="page226" ></a><span class="pagenum">226</span>hawsers aboard, and towed them off. Having surprised the camp
in dead silence, when once the carnage began they added to the panic
by making the whole place ring with shouts. Awakened by their wounds
the Romans hunted for weapons and rushed along the <a name="fnm545" id="fnm545"></a>streets,<a href="#fn545" class="fnnum">545</a>
some few in uniform, most of them with their clothes wrapped round
their arms and a drawn sword in their hand. The general, who was
half-asleep and almost naked, was only saved by the enemy's mistake.
His flag-ship being easily distinguishable, they carried it off,
thinking he was there. But Cerialis had been spending the night
elsewhere; as most people believed, carrying on an intrigue with a
Ubian woman named Claudia Sacrata. The sentries sheltered their
guilt under the general's disgrace, pretending that they had orders
to keep quiet and not disturb him: so they had dispensed with the
bugle-call and the challenge on rounds, and dropped off to sleep
themselves. In full daylight the enemy sailed off with their captive
vessels and towed the flag-ship up the Lippe as an offering to
Veleda.<a name="fnm546" id="fnm546"></a><a href="#fn546" class="fnnum">546</a></p>

<p><a name="Vchap23" id="Vchap23"></a><span class="chapnum">23</span>Civilis was now seized with a desire to make a naval
display. He manned all the available biremes and all the ships with
single banks of oars, and added to this fleet an immense number of
small craft. These carry thirty or forty men apiece and are rigged
like Illyrian <a name="fnm547" id="fnm547"></a>cruisers.<a href="#fn547" class="fnnum">547</a> The small craft he had <a name="fnm548" id="fnm548"></a>captured<a href="#fn548" class="fnnum">548</a>
were <a name="page227" id="page227" ></a><span class="pagenum">227</span>worked with bright, parti-coloured plaids, which served as
sails and made a fine show. He chose for review the miniature sea of
water where the Rhine comes pouring down to the ocean through the
mouth of the <a name="fnm549" id="fnm549"></a>Maas.<a href="#fn549" class="fnnum">549</a> His reason for the demonstration&mdash;apart from
Batavian vanity&mdash;was to scare away the provision-convoys that were
already on their way from Gaul. Cerialis, who was less alarmed than
astonished, at once formed up a fleet. Though inferior in numbers,
he had the advantage of larger ships, experienced rowers, and clever
pilots. The Romans had the stream with them, the Germans the wind.
So they sailed past each other, and after trying a few shots with
light missiles they parted. Civilis without more ado retired across
the <a name="fnm550" id="fnm550"></a>Rhine.<a href="#fn550" class="fnnum">550</a> Cerialis vigorously laid waste the island of the
Batavi, and employed the common device of leaving Civilis's houses
and fields <a name="fnm551" id="fnm551"></a>untouched.<a href="#fn551" class="fnnum">551</a> They were now well into autumn. The heavy
equinoctial rains had set the river in flood and thus turned the
marshy, low-lying island into a sort of lake. Neither fleet nor
provision-convoys had arrived, and their camp on the flat plain
began to be washed away by the force of the current.</p>

<p><a name="page228" id="page228" ></a><span class="pagenum">228</span><a name="Vchap24" id="Vchap24"></a><span class="chapnum">24</span>Civilis afterwards claimed that at this point the Germans
could have crushed the Roman legions and wanted to do so, but that
he had cunningly dissuaded them. Nor does this seem far from true,
since his surrender followed in a few days' time. Cerialis had been
sending secret messages, promising the Batavians peace and Civilis
pardon, urging Veleda and her <a name="fnm552" id="fnm552"></a>relatives<a href="#fn552" class="fnnum">552</a> to change the fortune
of a war that had only brought disaster after disaster, by doing a
timely service to <a name="fnm553" id="fnm553"></a>Rome.<a href="#fn553" class="fnnum">553</a> 'The Treviri,' he reminded them, 'had
been slaughtered; the allegiance of the Ubii recovered; the
Batavians robbed of their home. By supporting Civilis they had
gained nothing but bloodshed, banishment, and bereavement. He was a
fugitive exile, a burden to those who harboured him. Besides, they
had earned blame enough by crossing the Rhine so often: if they took
any further steps,&mdash;from the one side they might expect insult and
injury, from the other vengeance and the wrath of heaven.'</p>

<p><a name="Vchap25" id="Vchap25"></a><span class="chapnum">25</span>Thus Cerialis mingled threats and promises. The loyalty of
the tribes across the Rhine was shaken, and murmurs began to make
themselves heard among the Batavi. 'How much further is our ruin to
go?' they asked. 'One tribe cannot free the whole world from the
yoke. What good have we done by slaughtering and burning Roman
legions except to bring out others, larger and stronger? If it was
to help Vespasian that we have fought so vigorously, Vespasian is
master of the world. If we are challenging Rome&mdash;what an
<a name="page229" id="page229" ></a><span class="pagenum">229</span>infinitesimal fraction of the human race we Batavians are! We must
remember what burdens Raetia and Noricum and all Rome's other allies
bear. From us they levy no tribute, only our manhood and our
men.<a name="fnm554" id="fnm554"></a><a href="#fn554" class="fnnum">554</a> That is next door to freedom. And, after all, if we have
to choose our masters, it is less disgrace to put up with Roman
emperors than with German priestesses.' Thus the common people: the
chieftains used more violent language. 'It was Civilis' lunacy that
had driven them to war. He wanted to remedy his private
<a name="fnm555" id="fnm555"></a>troubles<a href="#fn555" class="fnnum">555</a> by ruining his country. The Batavians had incurred the
wrath of heaven by blockading Roman legions, murdering Roman
officers, and plunging into a war which was useful for one of them
and deadly for the rest. Now they had reached the limit, unless they
came to their senses and openly showed their repentance by punishing
the culprit.'</p>

<p><a name="Vchap26" id="Vchap26"></a><span class="chapnum">26</span>Civilis was well aware of their changed feelings and
determined to forestall them. He was tired of hardship, and he felt,
besides, that desire to live which so often weakens the resolution
of the bravest spirits. He demanded an interview. The bridge over
the river <a name="fnm556" id="fnm556"></a>Nabalia<a href="#fn556" class="fnnum">556</a> was broken down in the middle, and the two
generals advanced on to the broken ends. Civilis began as follows:
'If I were defending myself before one of Vitellius' officers, I
could expect neither <a name="page230" id="page230" ></a><span class="pagenum">230</span>pardon for my conduct nor credence for my
words. Between him and me there has been nothing but hatred. He
began the quarrel, I fostered it. Towards Vespasian I have from the
beginning shown respect. When he was a private citizen, we were
known as friends. Antonius Primus was aware of this when he wrote
urging me to take up arms to prevent the legions from Germany and
the Gallic levies from crossing the <a name="fnm557" id="fnm557"></a>Alps.<a href="#fn557" class="fnnum">557</a> The instructions
which Antonius gave in his letter Hordeonius Flaccus ratified by
word of mouth. I raised the standard in Germania, as did Mucianus in
Syria, Aponius in Moesia, Flavianus in Pannonia....'</p>
